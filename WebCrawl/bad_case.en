action de in rem verso (dee in rem v&lt;&lt;schwa&gt;&gt;r-soh). [Latin “action for money applied to(the defendant's) advantage"] 1.Roman &amp; civil law. An action for unjust enrichment, in which theplaintiff must show that an enrichment was bestowed, that the enrichment caused animpoverishment, that there is no justification for the enrichment and impoverishment, and  that theplaintiff has no other adequate remedy at law, including no remedy under an express or impliedcontract, 2.Roman law. An action brought against a paterfamilias or a slaveowner who benefitedfrom the transaction of a child or slave. -Also termed (in both senses) actio de in rem verso.
Action: The big blind checks. What do you do?Answer: That's a good but not great flop for you - threecards all lower than your pair, but with possible straight andflush draws out there. You should now bet something likethree-fourths of the pot. If you get raised, be prepared to goall the way. Since you have two tens, it's unlikely you'refacing someone with the high end of the straight, and it's veryunlikely that anyone called before the flop with a five-four.
Action: The small blind checks. What do you do?Answer: You have trip tens. The board now shows twospades and two diamonds, so there are plenty of drawsavailable.Youprobably have the best hand now, but decidinghow much to bet is a problem. You've got two competinggoals: betting a small enough amount to get people to call,but a large enough amount to get the drawers to fold.

A donk bet is simply an initial bet on the flop into the preflop raiser. As an example, suppose that the preflop action is folded to the player in third position who raises. The action folds around to the big blind who calls. The flop comes and the big blind, instead of checking to the raiser, makes a bet.

advantages: reduced  ap bulk, improved  ap insetting, design, and choice). Therefore, a perforator  ap can be de ned as one that  is based on a pedicle that has been skeletonized from its intramus-cular course (excluding the muscle) by retrograde intramuscular  dissection (e.g., anterolateral thigh free  ap based on a vessel that  traverses the vastus lateralis muscle). If the same  ap is based on  a pedicle that has no intramuscular course, there is no donor site  morbidity to be spared (muscle is anatomically excluded), intra-muscular dissection is not required, and it is not a perforator  ap  by this de nition (e.g., anterolateral thigh free  ap based on a sep-tocutaneous vessel).

Affery had so vivid a fear of his going stealthily up-stairs the moment her back was turned, that after hurrying out of sight, she returned to the gateway to peep at him. Seeing him still on the threshold, more out of the house than in it, as if he had no love for darkness and no desire to probe its mysteries, she flew into the next street, and sent a message into the tavern to Mr Flintwinch, who came out directly. The two returning together—the lady in advance, and Mr Flintwinch coming up briskly behind, animated with the hope of shaking her before she could get housed—saw the gentleman standing in the same place in the dark, and heard the strong voice of Mrs Clennam calling from her room, ‘Who is it? What is it? Why does no one answer? Who is that, down there?’

After a while with no strikes, I reeled in my line and walked across the riffle, under the bridge, and around Megan, who was casting perfect loops into the plunge pool and toward the undercut distant bank. She smiled. I smiled too. Life was good.

After his atrocious preflop call, the player with jack-sevenplayed his hand correctly. On the flop, the pot size was 24.5 betswhen the action got to him, and it was two bets to call. He held agutshot, which is about 11-to-1 to come on the turn. He wasgetting over 12-to-1, so he correctly called. On fourth street, thepot was 16.5 big bets when the action got to him. He still had an11-to-1 chance to make his straight, and he was getting 16.5-to-1,so his call was again correct. The point is that the player withkings lost because he failed to protect his hand.

And so then they departed either from other; and then either party made them ready on the morn for to do battle, and great purveyance was made on both sides; and Sir Gawaine let purvey many knights for to wait upon Sir Launcelot, for to overset him and to slay him. And on the morn at underne Sir Arthur was ready in the field with three great hosts. And then Sir Launcelot’s fellowship came out at three gates, in a full good array; and Sir Lionel came in the foremost battle, and Sir Launcelot came in the middle, and Sir Bors came out at the third gate. Thus they came in order and rule, as full noble knights; and always Sir Launcelot charged all his knights in any wise to save King Arthur and Sir Gawaine.

And then there are the pure dialect words, which are charming when you get to know them but initially incomprehensible: ‘me dei’ instead of ‘mei you’, meaning ‘have not’; ‘sa zi’ instead of ‘shen me’ for ‘what?’, ‘bu shaodi’ instead of ‘wo bu zhi dao’ for ‘I don’t know’; not to mention a whole gamut of fruity slang and swear words. Luckily, my burning curiosity aboutSichuanese cookery spurred me on to retune my ears and tongue, and I learnt,fast.

And then he pounced on Tom, and told him that he wanted to relieve himself of all his old constraint; and in the first place shook him by one hand, and in the second place shook him by the other, and in the third place nudged him in the waistcoat, and in the fourth place said, 'How are you?' and in a great many other places did a great many other things to show his friendliness and joy. And he sang songs, did Fips; and made speeches, did Fips; and knocked off his wine pretty handsomely, did Fips; and in short, he showed himself a perfect Trump, did Fips, in all respects.

Anson’s squadron received scores of pressed men. Cheap processed at least sixty-five for the Centurion; however distasteful he might have found the press, he needed every sailor he could get. Yet the unwilling recruits deserted at the first opportunity, as did volunteers who were having misgivings. In a single day, thirty men vanished from the Severn. Of the sick men sent to Gosport, countless took advantage of the lax security to flee—or, as one admiral put it, “go off as soon as they can crawl.” Altogether, more than 240 men absconded from the squadron, including the Gloucester’s chaplain. When Captain Kidd dispatched a press gang to find new recruits for the Wager, six members of the gang itself deserted.
Answer: The third spade came, so if he was drawing to hisflush, he just hit it. However, he hasn't been betting asthough he had a drawing hand. (He led out after the flop, andagain on fourth street, when he could have checked andgotten free cards.) If you have a feeling that he's beenbluffing, you should check to induce one last bluff. (If he'sbeen bluffing, that will be his last chance to win the pot.) Ifyou don't think he's been bluffing, you should check andmake your final decision after he bets. In either case, a checkis probably the correct action.

a tendency to travel in a transverse direction. The length of the  skin paddle when placed vertically should not exceed two-thirds  of the muscle length. One or two large musculocutaneous perfo-rators exit the medial or lateral side of the muscle. Septocutane-ous perforators may arise from the main gracilis vascular pedicle  between the adductor longus and the gracilis m uscle. More fre-quently the signi cant septocutaneous perforator is from the  rst  minor pedicle distal to the main pedicle, which is a direct branch  of the super cial femoral artery. These proximal musculocuta-neous and septocutaneous perforators contribute to success of  the transverse orientation of the skin paddle. Anatomic studies  suggest that sm all-volum e  aps can be harvested based on the septocutaneous perforator from  the m inor pedicle with no need  for muscle harvest.

A very strong hand on this board would be either the nuts (a Royal flush), the second nuts (four jacks), or the better full houses. The third nuts right now are a pair of aces for the best possible full house, followed by a pair of queens, followed by ace-jack or queen-jack.

Bakugou had barely managed to take a breath, but he shot an explosion off that served as an attack and means to get away from Deku. A close up fight would work to Deku’s advantage and he couldn’t allow that. Deku kicked up into a handstand and pushed off the ground with his hands to escape the brunt of the explosion, only to have to use his hands to fend off another kick from Iida. He blocked two, missed one that connected with his side, and ducked to dodge another before swiping a foot under Iida’s ankles. With Iida distracted, he jumped to grab onto the wire of magically still hanging street light and swing out of the way. He landed on top of a car and paused to catch his breath while holding his side.
Bar 22 was a breakout pullback short but it followed a small doji, which  might have been the start of the second leg up, so many scalpers would not  have shorted at the bottom of what could have soon been the bottom of the  second leg up.
bar is the bullish divergent entry bar, where the signal from the previous day was hit and filled. We are now long from this point. The next circled price bar on September 23 is a super AO signal bar, creating a buy signal one tick above the high of this bar. The following bar on September 24 is both a super AO entry bar (from the signal the day before) and a Fractal sig-nal bar. Notice there are price bars with two lower highs on each side of this bar creating a Fractal signal one tick above this bar. Then nothing hap-pens for a few days, until the circled bar on October 4, which is a Fractal entry bar for the previously mentioned Fractal signal. The next circled bar on October 13 is an exit bar based on the price dropping below the lowest low of the five preceding  bars.       To summarize this typical stock trade:

Barnaby, heavily ironed as he was, if he had obeyed his first impulse, or if he had been alone, would have made his way back to the side of Hugh, who to his clouded intellect now shone forth with the new lustre of being his preserver and truest friend. But his father’s terror of remaining in the streets, communicated itself to him when he comprehended the full extent of his fears, and impressed him with the same eagerness to fly to a place of safety.
Barnaby, thus condescendingly addressed, produced his bird, but not without much fear and trembling, and set him down upon the ground; which he had no sooner done than Grip drew fifty corks at least, and then began to dance; at the same time eyeing the gentleman with surprising insolence of manner, and screwing his head so much on one side that he appeared desirous of screwing it off upon the spot.

Because I know he’s just been in with Claire talking about laying people off. And he doesn’t know I know that.

Before Todoroki could react or even think to help him, a bolt of green lightning leaped off the edge of the structure and shouted, “Kacchan!” All he could do was watch, still in a crouched position, as Midoriya caught Bakugou around the middle right before he hit the water and turned their bodies so that he crashed into it first.
Being back in this stupid safe house was already starting to grate on Bakugou’s nerves. With Uraraka gone, it didn’t serve a purpose in his mind since there was no one to protect (with Todoroki gone, no one was going to lump him in that category, but he couldn’t even revel in that), but they had decided to make it a base of operations. It made sense with all of Hatsume’s equipment here, but he was wary since the League had a hold of two of their own and could find out the location of this place from them.
Being proper grown-ups, we stop eating our all-you-can-eat breakfast when we’ve actually had as much as we want instead of filling our boots on principle, and then we go for a nice little wander around the middle of Sheffield, which with Jonathan in tow I’m seeing in a bit of a new light. I mean don’t get me wrong it’s still just a town, and not one that austerity was especially kind to, but to Jonathan it’s got that childhood home thing going for it that I get myself back in Liverpool.
Below the premium pairs and the middle pairs lie the six small pairs: sevens down through deuces. These hands occupy an odd little niche all their own. Before the flop, a small pair is likely to be the best hand at the table. You’re only dealt a pair once in 17 hands, so if you pick up a small pair under-the-gun at a nine-handed table, you’re a favorite to have the best hand at that point. However, once the flop arrives, the value of a small pair either soars or plummets. If you hit a set, (about 7.5-to-1 against) you have a monster hand. If not, you’ll probably be facing some number of overcards and now hold a bluffing hand with very few outs.

Besides charging any draws a hefty price to call, the big bet simplifies your action in case of a raise from either player. If the hijack seat folds and the small blind raises, he’ll need to raise all-in and you will then call. If the hijack raises to 80,000 or 90,000 and the small blind folds, you should move all-in yourself. Your hand is likely best and you still have outs even if has a made straight.

But by this time Mr Pogram had freshened himself up, and had composed his hair and features after the Pogram statue, so that any one with half an eye might cry out, ‘There he is! as he delivered the Defiance!’ The Committee were embellished also; and when they entered the ladies’ ordinary in a body, there was much clapping of hands from ladies and gentlemen, accompanied by cries of ‘Pogram! Pogram!’ and some standing up on chairs to see him.

But if that righteous brother hadn’t shown up on the scene when he did, those cops would probably have gone right back down to that meat-packing factory—if there ever was one—and really torn the door off the hinges, loading my Eldorado up with hamhocks, pigs’ feet, hog maws, and chitterlings, and then charged me with breaking into the place, while their families ate the T-bone steaks, prime ribs, and the other choice cuts of meat that they would have kept for themselves. As it was though, because of that brother, they had to let me go.

But there is no more “fold.” It is impossible to resolve anything with them, because they, too, insist with all their might. And they have the protection of such powerful persons as Bishop Dembowski (at the mention of this name there is an uneasy shuffling) as well as Bishop Sołtyk (at this the majority of the rabbis stare down at the dark floor, and one of them sighs plaintively).
But the  thing did not then leave the vicinity of the boat.

But when Dame Elaine saw Sir Launcelot that would not speak unto her she was so heavy that she weened her heart would have to-brast; for wit you well, out of measure she loved him. And then Elaine said unto her woman, Dame Brisen: the unkindness of Sir Launcelot slayeth me near. Ah, peace, madam, said Dame Brisen, I will undertake that this night he shall lie with you, an ye would hold you still. That were me liefer, said Dame Elaine, than all the gold that is above the earth. Let me deal, said Dame Brisen. So when Elaine was brought unto Queen Guenever either made other good cheer by countenance, but nothing with hearts. But all men and women spake of the beauty of Dame Elaine, and of her great riches.
But without qualification two is few; for it is first plurality which is deficient (for this reason Anaxagoras was not right in leaving the subject with the statement that 'all things were together, boundless both in plurality and in smallness'-where for 'and in smallness' he should have said 'and in fewness'; for they could not have been boundless in fewness), since it is not one, as some say, but two, that make a few.

Callery says here:-’ Cest toujours l’application de la théorie des affinités naturelles dont nous avons parlé (see note, ) et dont il importe de bien se pénétrer lorsqu’on veut comprendre quelque chose aux dissertations philosophiques des Chinois.’ But after the student has done his best to get hold of the theory, he will often be baffled in trying to follow the applications of it. For example, I cannot get hold of what is said here about the genesis of the moon. Much of the next four paragraphs is very obscure. A little light seems to flash on them from parts of different sections of Book IV, but it is neither bright nor steady.

Carol Fiedler Kawaguchi, who repairs and refinishes furniture through her business, C-Saw, on Bainbridge Island in Washington, said she has sometimes been able to get bubbles on veneer flat again by slicing them, poking in a little hide glue on the side of a knife blade, and then clamping the veneer until the glue dries. If the patch is too far from an edge to secure clamps, she uses thick pieces of wood to span the table and clamps them near the edges. Wax paper can keep excess glue from also gluing down the boards.

Case No. 2: Out of position with nothing. When you call preflop out of position and miss the flop, your default play is to check and fold to a c-bet. Floating (calling without a hand with the idea of taking the pot away on a later street) is too difficult when you have to act first. However, there are situations where bluffing at the pot makes sense. Here’s an example.
Casting along the drop-off, I managed another hookup in short order, bringing in a yellow-bellied sunfish and then another largemouth in the one-pound range. I noticed how the submerged rock-line turned along the far edge of the river and cast toward that transition. I had settled into the casual rhythm of casting, letting my streamer swing into the current and stripping back without really paying attention as much as I should have been. It was right about then that the waters parted, and a bucket-mouthed monster inhaled the helpless Clouser. This fish could have eaten the last one in a single gulp. I was so shocked by the strike that I didn’t set the hook properly, and with its first and only headshaking leap, this denizen of the semi-deep spit my fur and feather offering in my face.

Chapter XI. 66. The Master said:— ‘What is it that the Yî does? The Yî opens up (the knowledge of the issues of) things, accomplishes the undertakings (of men), and embraces under it (the way of) all things under the sky. This and nothing more is what the Yî does. Thereby the sages, through (divination by) it, would give their proper course to the aims of all under the sky, would give stability to their undertakings, and determine their doubts.’
Chapter XV. 1. Tsze-kung asked which of the two, Shih or Shang, was the superior. The Master said, “Shih goes beyond the due mean, and Shang does not come up to it.”
Chapter XXI. Tsze-lu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard. The Master said, “There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted; — why should you act on that principle of immediately carrying into practice what you hear?” Zan Yu asked the same, whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and the Master answered, “Immediately carry into practice what you hear.” Kung-hsi Hwa said, “Yu asked whether he should carry immediately into practice what he heard, and you said, ‘There are your father and elder brothers to be consulted.’ Ch’iu asked whether he should immediately carry into practice what he heard, and you said, ‘Carry it immediately into practice.’ I, Ch’ih, am perplexed, and venture to ask you for an explanation.” The Master said, “Ch’iu is retiring and slow; therefore,
Checking has one additional advantage. If he picked up a flush draw on the turn and bet as a semi-bluff, he might now be inclined to bluff the river. You, after all, haven’t shown any great strength. You called preflop from the big blind, checked the flop, and called a bet on the turn. From his point of view, your most likely hands are second pair, a pair like tens, nines, or eights, or maybe a straight or flush draw that missed. A bluff on the river might well work.
Checking the flop and betting the turn is called a delayed c-bet, and it serves both as a pot control move and a balancing move. It’s a useful addition to your repertoire; beginners and intermediates don’t use it enough.

Confucius said, ‘In the mourning sacrifices for the son of Heaven and the prince of a state, none but those who wear the sackcloth with the jagged edges take part in them.

Confucius said, ‘When an officer is required to shoot, if he be not able, he declines on the ground of being ill, with reference to the bow suspended at the left of the door (at his birth).’
connected flop: A flop whose cards are all close together, with two of the same suit. Connected flops are dangerous since they create possible flush and straight draws.
Cons: they are very heavy, they do not lay well (bulky at track) which made it harder to hide with my fine hair, I tried to curl and it did not take at all I had to wear them straight.

Course 3， which is a compromise between 1 and 2， its essential principle being to sell the new wines above their value， in order to be able to sell the old below their value. And it is clearly desirable， as far as possible， to make the reductions where they will be felt， and the additions where they will not be felt. Moreover it seems to me that reduction is most felt where it goes down to the next round sum， and an addition in the reverse case， i.e.， when it starts from a round sum. Thus， if we were to take 2d. off a 5s. 8d. wine， and add it to a 4s. 4d.—thus selling them at 5s. 6d. and 4s. 6d. the reduction would be welcomed， and the addition unnoticed； and the change would be a popular one.

double barrel: A bluff where you miss the flop but make a continuation bet, get called, and then make another bet on the turn.
Drawing hands are everything that isn’t a big pair, big cards, or trash. They include medium and small pairs, medium and small suited connectors, and everything else involving medium and small cards that’s worth playing. Pairs and medium suited connectors are the best drawing hands because they make strong hands more often.
Drawing hands are weaker than before. From the above example, we can see that any drawing hand that hasn’t connected by the turn will probably not get the odds it needs to continue. Even a half pot bet on the turn will be giving a drawing hand only 3-to-1 odds, whereas the odds of hitting a flush or an open-ended straight draw with no extra outs will be between 4-and 5-to-1. Therefore, to play a drawing hand, you would need to feel that it was likely that extra money could be won on the river (or that you think a bluff has a good chance of being successful on the river).

Elation swells in his chest, cut short by the sudden tightening of Kiyoomi’s grip. The alpha’s face is blank, but something appraising in his stare sends a frisson of warning up Atsumu’s spine. In a feat of core strength that shouldn’t be possible, Kiyoomi forces them up and flips Atsumu onto his back, reversing their positions and pinning the omega’s hands above his head. Panic grips Atsumu, his instincts reacting to being held down by an alpha. He calms himself before the fear can leak into his scent, baring his teeth at the man above him. Thrashing, Kiyoomi keeps his iron grip on Atsumu, bracing himself to keep his perch. The countdown begins again, but this time, Atsumu feels nothing but ice.

Elevate the anterior edge of the LD muscle o  the underlying SA  muscle (Fig. 30.8). At this juncture, the two muscles interdigitate, and care needs to be taken not to inadvertently include the SA  muscle  bers in the  ap. The two muscles may be di erentiated by  the direction of the muscle  bers; the long  bers of the latissimus dorsi run vertically while the serratus anterior muscle  bers follow  the direction of the ribs. Once past, the plane becomes well de ned  and dissection proceeds smoothly aided by posterior retraction of  the LD. Medially, perforators from the posterior intercostal and  lumbar arteries are encountered; these are ligated with hemoclips.

five-tick failure A trade in the Emini that reaches five ticks beyond the signal  bar and then reverses. For example, a breakout of a bull flag runs five ticks, and once the bar closes, the next bar has a low that is lower. Most limit  orders to take a one-point profit would fail to get filled since a move usually  has to go one tick beyond the order before it is filled. It is often a setup for a  trade in the opposite direction.

If he hits one of his nine flush cards, he wins. The chance of him hitting a flush card is 9 in 44, giving him pot equity of about 20 percent. Your pot equity is the remaining 80 percent.

Gojo cradles his palm against Nanami’s cheek and draws him out from the crook of his neck, smiling faintly at the dazed, scent and alcohol drunk look on his face. He kisses him, so soft and so gentle, barely a whisper of his lips against Nanami’s.
Gojo floats through the rest of the day, pleased when he manages to reach the end of it without any unmanageable crises or issues coming up. Ijichi attempts to catch him on his way out the door but Gojo dances out of reach, speed walking away as fast as his long legs can take him until the school is nothing but a distant memory behind him.
Gojo knows he must be tired because he doesn’t voice a single complaint when the Alpha picks him up and instead just tucks his face into the safety of Gojo’s neck. He’s been fairly quiet the last two days, and Gojo would be more nervous about that if Nanami hadn’t spent that entire time refusing to allow Gojo out of his sight for even a second.
Gojo looked at her carefully, the smile fading a little, though he battled to hold onto it.
Gojo saw a mental image of Utahime beaten to a pulp flash in his mind and he felt a sharp tug in his chest. Then he remembered the blood puddle in the restroom and knew it wasn't all. But he didn't want to hear any more. He didn't need to.
Gojo’s voice startles him and he whips around to see him standing there with a smirk on his face, looking absolutely mouthwatering in a stylish, neatly tailored black suit. The black shirt and dark blue tie that go with it look good on him and Nanami can’t help but gawk, trying to parse this Gojo with the one he sees in his baggy uniform pants and jacket every day.

He watched as your face flushed and you drew in a breath.
He’d showed up at his apartment unannounced just as Nanami was leaving, and while he isn’t opposed to the idea of someone being around to help him get his groceries home, he underestimated just how taxing a bored Gojo can be. He’s not entirely underfoot, but he’s impatient, and he keeps attempting to sneak snacks into Nanami’s carriage that he is absolutely not paying for.

He had reached the turn and was thinking of ebbing back when the boots from Wynn’s came in and handed him a telegram. FOUND STOP LOOK SLIPPY STOP COOPER. He was still laughing and crying, to the great relief of the curates, who had grown to detest and dread that frozen face day after day at their counters, when the boots returned with a second telegram. LOST STOP STOP WHERE YOU ARE STOP COOPER.

He is partially right. Many small stakes players play too manyhands and go too far with them. They start with a weak holding,flop something like bottom pair, and call on the flop and turn,hoping to improve. Then, when they fail to improve, they call onthe river (hoping that the bettor is bluffing).
He laughed. “Hey, it's not much of a closet is it?”
Hello Betty I would like to know where my sister is shut up and sleeping or running around and having fun with her kids.

He looked down at me with that serious expression. The one that didn’t last long but always made me sorry if I was the one that brought it to the surface.
He nudges his nose against Nanami’s and chuckles when the omega turns his head to look at him. Nanami is tall for an omega, but Gojo is even taller so it works out. He likes that he can brush his knuckles under Nanami’s chin to tip his face up that last little bit and finally slot their lips together.
Here Bazzard awoke himself by his own snoring; and, as is usual in such cases, sat apoplectically staring at vacancy, as defying vacancy to accuse him of having been asleep.
Here is an example of the way in which the packs may turn out. We will suppose that the inquirer is represented by the queen of clubs. Her choice falls on the middle pack, which contains the following cards: the knave of clubs, the eight of diamonds, reversed, the eight of hearts, and the queen of spades.
Here’s a paired flop that’s almost as dry as the previous one. Straight draws are out, but a heart flush draw is now possible. If you c-bet this flop and get a call, you’re likely up against one of three hands: a nine, a medium pocket pair in the range of jacks through fives, or a flush draw.
Here’s the opposite of a dry flop: the wet flop. These flops connect strongly with many of the medium-card hands that a caller can be expected to have. If our caller’s hand contained a queen, jack, ten, nine, or eight, he now has at least a pair or an open-ended straight draw, and he could easily have two pair, a set, or a made straight. In addition, the two hearts mean that about 20 percent of his suited hands now have a flush draw. 2

her smell nor taste anything more distinct than a vague tobacco-ish flavor. Other blends I have taste fine， so I know this isn't just a COVID thing. I noticed as I went to review this that it is out of stock， and I'm wondering if， since I apparently purchased some of the last of this batch， maybe it was just old and had gone bland. Maybe? It was quite dry when I received it， so maybe so. I didn't want to give this one star， but to me it tastes like nothing.
He said: "We are for everyone equally. Plaid Cymru speaks your language, whatever that language is."
He scoffed. “I just want to see what all the noise is about. You people that keep talking about this knacking, knacking, every time knacking.”
He seemed, she thought, more like he had looked at Netherfield, than as he had when she had seen him at Pemberley.
He’s heard that an omega’s first heat is supposed to be miserable and utterly intolerable, and while the itch is like a swarm of ants over his entire body Yuuta finds that he’s able to tune the worst of it out by focusing instead on the tight ring of Inumaki’s arms around his waist, and the warmth of Maki’s skin as she patiently lets him scent her.
He’s sure meeting Megumi could have been painfully awkward for both of them but with Gojo’s loud, playful behavior and excitable introductions it’s hard for Nanami to feel uncomfortable. Maybe this is why Gojo is so over the top all the time.
He started to panic, as most of his ideas would probably be boring to her. Just as his luck would have it, though, Miles Edgeworth showed up, taking in the whole scene he managed to stumble upon. Klavier and Apollo said very quick goodbyes and apologies, moving out of the doorway to make room for Miles.
He still looked a little annoyed. Phoenix was torn between finally getting this weight off of his chest and letting Edgeworth have his afternoon of grading back. On one hand, Zak’s news had been eating away at him the past week, and he really wasn’t sure how much longer he could keep the secret from anyone. Besides, Zak had wanted to talk to Trucy about it, but Phoenix hadn’t even told her yet. He needed to, he knew that.
He stopped to look into her eyes again, and seeing, in a hasty glance over his shoulder, that there was no one near, and that Mark was still intent upon the fog, not only looked at her lips, too, but kissed them into the bargain.

However, before we talk about the different hand types, we need to talk a bit about limping, or entering the pot with a call rather than a raise. Should we ever limp into a pot, and if so, when?
However, dual writes have some serious problems, one of which is a race condition
However, it’s not long before the mice begin to catch on.
However, notice one crucial point. If you decide to 3-bet with any of the middle pairs, it’s impoirtant to know how you’re going to respond to a 4-bet, either from the original raiser or from someone else at the table. In any event, this is good practice, but it’s not as important if you have a premium pair that you’re willing to take all the way, or if you have something like a suited connector that you can just fold. It’s worth a lot to see a flop with middle pairs, so before you jeopardize that by raising, make sure you’ve decided on a response in case your opponent fires back.
However, some things are reliable enough that you should act on them. For example, suppose your opponent plays only pocket pairs and ace-king, and he moves all-in on the flop only with a set. (Exceedingly tight players like this one inhabit some online games. They are colloquially called “set farmers.”) If he moves all-in on the flop, you should give him credit for having a set. It doesn’t matter if you have an overpair of aces and your SPR is at your target for a “normal” player. This player isn’t normal. You should lay down. You should adjust similarly when you notice other reliable betting tells and physical tells. This is just a friendly reminder that, while SPR is an extremely useful tool, sometimes a little common sense and hand reading will suggest a clear alternate play.
However, that's neither here nor there, just now. She went home to breakfast, and had scarcely caught the full flavour of her first sip of tea, when the servant announced a gentleman, whereat Miss La Creevy, at once imagining a new sitter transfixed by admiration at the street-door case, was in unspeakable consternation at the presence of the tea-things.
However, the play I like is raising to about 1,000. Dry king-high flops are prime flops for continuation betting because it’s hard for anyone to hit them. Your opponent probably thinks you missed, and it’s likely he missed as well. So rather than play the hand out of position, make a cheap check-raise bluff and try to win it now. If he reraises, your hand can hit the muck, and if he calls, you’re done with the hand unless you hit something good on the turn.
However, there is no getting away from the fact that in one important respect the Porsche feels bang up to date. It is extremely fast. Bonkers. Insane. Eye-swivelling.

If it wasn’t for that little admission he let slip in return—the one thing for the other, it almost seemed. That he was retiring in four weeks, that this was his last real case. And they’d put him on it because it was a simple mopping-up. No complications—except me, so it seemed. He might have leaned on me pretty hard, and he did a bit. Grey shifting eyes. So that while he had me there on the spot, and sweating, on the other side of the table, it was as though he too was on the edge of some scary gap, and I was even the one holding out a hand and saying, Come on, you can do it, you can take the jump.

If Little Dorrit found herself left a little lonely and a little low that night, nothing would have done so much against her feeling of depression as the being able to sit at work by her father, as in the old time, and help him to his supper and his rest. But that was not to be thought of now, when they sat in the state-equipage with Mrs General on the coach-box. And as to supper! If Mr Dorrit had wanted supper, there was an Italian cook and there was a Swiss confectioner, who must have put on caps as high as the Pope’s mitre, and have performed the mysteries of Alchemists in a copper-saucepaned laboratory below, before he could have got it.

If stacks are deep, just call because you have the implied odds to try to flop a set. On the other hand, three-betting is more problematic since you risk being bet off the hand if your opponent comes back with a 4-bet and you have to fold. Notice that this is not a result you want if your hand has the potential to flop a monster. So calling a raise when the stacks are deep is simple and good.

If you catch an ace on the turn, you will be ahead of the jacks, but behind a set. So aces are sometimes outs for you in this situation. You have to discount the ace outs for those times they won’t make the best hand.
If you flop top pair and you get it all-in， you will be an underdog. You could be behind to ace-king， a bigger pair， or a set， but most of the time you will be behind. The pot isn’t large enough compared to the remaining stacks to risk it all on just top pair.

If you look at the B1-C1-D1 pattern, it is a head-and-shoulders bottom on the weekly scale.
If your call is so easy, should you 3-bet? It’s not a terrible play, but you won’t be happy if your opponent 4 bets, and if he simply calls your 3-bet, you’ll be playing a big pot out of position, facing either a higher pair or two overcards to your sixes. Furthermore, at this stage of the tournament where many players still have lots of chips, the idea is not to play huge pots out of position where you don’t know what’s happening. Put another way, you want to extract money from weaker players when it’s likely you have the best hand, so just calling is the prudent play.
If you're outraged by that sort of lookism, how can you afford to get calli? You're precisely the type of person who's needed to blow the whistle on that behavior, but if you've got calli, you won't be able to recognize it.
If your hand isn’t a monster, then getting all the chips in on the river shouldn’t be a major consideration. Let’s say you have two pair and think your opponent is likely to have top pair or a flush draw, but there’s some chance he has you beaten with a set. In this case, a simple bet of half the pot or even a little less is more appropriate.
• If your pot equity is relatively large， seldom fold. Instead， choose between calling and semibluff raising. Tend to just call with strong implied odds， and raise when your implied odds are weaker. Remember， good implied odds means you expect your draw to make the best hand and your opponent to pay you off when you hit. A hidden straight draw will have better implied odds than a one-card flush draw. The nut flush draw against a loose opponent has much stronger implied odds than a low flush draw against a tight opponent.35 You should be more inclined to call with the nut flush draw against a loose opponent and raise with the low flush draw against the tight opponent.

If you think your opponent may be sandbagging, you shouldcheck (and call on the river). The disadvantages of being check-raised outweigh the advantages of betting. But if you do not feara check-raise, bet. If you are ahead, betting protects your hand andgives your opponent the opportunity to make a weak call. If youare behind, it sets up a free showdown.

Instantly recovering his self-possession, however, the Captain's first care was to place her on dry land, which he happily accomplished, with one motion of his arm. Issuing forth, then, upon the main, Captain Cuttle took Miss Nipper round the waist, and bore her to the island also. Captain Cuttle, then, with great respect and admiration, raised the hand of Florence to his lips, and standing off a little(for the island was not large enough for three), beamed on her from the soap and water like a new description of Triton.
Instead of handing one to Cardan, I offer them both up for Madoc to choose between. Smiling, he takes the one the color of heart’s blood. I take the other.
In Tang dynasty Taoist texts, an attempt was made to synthesize the various cosmologies. In one systematization, the Great Canopy Heaven is placed above the twenty-eight heavens of the Three Realms (sanjie 三界, i.e., desire, form, formlessness), the Four Heavens of the Seed-People (si zhongmin tian 四種民天), and the Heavens of the Three Clarities (see table 20). As were many Taoist cosmological terms and imagery, the Great Canopy Heaven was also adopted as a metaphor for a celestial palace by Tang poets, particularly in the creations of Li Bai 李白 (Li Bo, 701–62) and *Wu Yun (?–778).
In the Arabian Mate, the knight and the rook team up to trap the opposing king on a corner of the board. The rook sits on a square adjacent to the king both to prevent escape along the diagonal and to deliver checkmate while the knight sits two squares away diagonally from the king to prevent escape on the square next to the king and to protect the rook.
in the big blind and call, and go to the flop with a pot of 800 chips. The flop is the
in the big blind of a $2-$5 blind game with $500 stacks. One player limps， the small blind calls， and you check. The pot is $15. The flop comes giving you top pair. The small blind checks， and you bet $10. Your limping opponent raises to $40， and the small blind folds. This is a small pot. There’s $65 in the pot， and you still have $485 remaining. Furthermore， you’re out of position with a questionable hand. Unless you can get a read that your opponent is raising with a weak holding， you should fold.
In the last section, we looked at double-barreling, which is a special case of bluffing the turn: firing a bluff after you had already made a continuation bet on the flop. However, that’s not the only kind of bluff possible. The turn offers a number of good bluffing opportunities even if you checked the flop. Let’s look at a few of them.
In the old days, when opening ranges in most positions were tight, c-betting this flop just meant you hit your ace-king, ace-queen, or ace-jack and now had a pair of aces. The normal betting action on the flop was c-bet and fold.
In the past few days, I would say.
In the threefold capacity, of the gentleman from outside who had been accidentally locked in on the night of his first appearance, of the gentleman from outside who had inquired into the affairs of the Father of the Marshalsea with the stupendous idea of getting him out, and of the gentleman from outside who took an interest in the child of the Marshalsea, Clennam soon became a visitor of mark.

I purposely lost the last two wagers I put down with Gutierrez, trying my best to make myself look foolish, just a garden-variety plunger who happened to get lucky once and would presently lose it all back, but my hunch-think told me it wasn’t playing very well. My hunch-think didn’t like it when Gutierrez started greeting me with, “Oh, see! Here comes my Yanqui from Yankeeland.” Not the Yanqui; my Yanqui.

Is the man continent who abides by any and every rule and any and every choice, or the man who abides by the right choice, and is he incontinent who abandons any and every choice and any and every rule, or he who abandons the rule that is not false and the choice that is right; this is how we put it before in our statement of the problem. Or is it incidentally any and every choice but per se the true rule and the right choice by which the one abides and the other does not? If any one chooses or pursues this for the sake of that, per se he pursues and chooses the latter, but incidentally the former. But when we speak without qualification we mean what is per se. Therefore in a sense the one abides by, and the other abandons, any and every opinion; but without qualification, the true opinion.
It can pay to check open interest in the options you wish to sell.
It follows therefore that when your two central limb op-tions have been drawn in that each central lim b will lead to a rhomboid, each of these rhom boids will then have two viable  ap options. This potentially gives us four viable  ap options  from two rhom boids for each lesion. The four colored squares (Fig. 60.17) show where each of these  aps would derive from.  Contrast this with the four  aps, all incorrect, derived from the  single rhom boid (the TIE Fighter in Fig. 60.7) that result if the  rhombus is planned  rst. You can see also that it is sim ilar to the  standard model (Fig. 60.11) but with improved angles and (crit-ically) all the options in one plan. The geom etry is shown again  in Fig. 60.18.
I think I remember everything, but based on my history, could I be sure of that? Maybe I blacked out. Maybe that other guard, whoever heard me yell, didn’t unlock the gate fast enough. Maybe, instead of Curly getting the better of me, I grabbed the shiv from him and…
It is also one hell of a thing to get hit with in the small of the back.
It is extremely improving and interesting to hear two political young gentlemen, of perse opinions, discuss some great question across a dinner-table; such as, whether, if the public were admitted to Westminster Abbey for nothing, they would or would not convey small chisels and hammers in their pockets, and immediately set about chipping all the noses off the statues; or whether, if they once got into the Tower for a shilling, they would not insist upon trying the crown on their own heads, and loading and firing off all the small arms in the armoury, to the great discomposure of Whitechapel and the Minories. Upon these, and many other momentous questions which agitate the public mind in these desperate days, they will discourse with great vehemence and irritation for a considerable time together, both leaving off precisely where they began, and each thoroughly persuaded that he has got the better of the other.

It occurred to Uraraka that this would be a good shot at trying to escape, but she didn’t even know where they could go. Besides, without her quirk, she felt more anxious than she wanted to admit and her ankle was starting to really hurt. She didn’t think it was broken, but after hitting it against the metal bar and bending it weirdly in that kick, she knew that she’d done something to it. Todoroki was standing, but holding Murai back had zapped the energy out of him.
It only took one bad block to leave her spinning head over heels as she fell, and Sephiroth promptly slid his blade in through her back.
I tried to keep my expectations low before coming here. Tonight was really meant for me to rip off the dating Band-Aid and try putting myself out there for the first time in forever.
It’s also possible that your opponent might be trapping with a big hand, but it’s more likely that he simply missed the flop and decided to check, or has a flush draw and decided not to semi-bluff. Thus right now, you believe your hand is best.
It’s a strange car, this: billed as a replacement for the solid, no-nonsense Freelander, it is badged as a Discovery and sits on the same running gear as a Range Rover Evoque. Confused? Mmm. I was too. So let me put it to you this way. It’s a seven-seat alternative to the rather too mumsy Volvo XC90. And a better-looking alternative to the standard Discovery, which, as we know, is mostly driven by murderers.
It’s been about a week since his heat and waiting for the other shoe to drop is exhausting. Because obviously it has to drop eventually right? At some point the novelty of keeping Nanami’s secret is going to wear off, or an opportunity to use it to his advantage will present itself to Gojo, and then it’ll be over.
It’s not a great flop for your hand, but there are some draws to guard against. So you make a good-sized continuation bet of 3,000 and your opponent calls. The pot is now 10,500 chips.
It stalls a lot. Doubtless for reasons that have a lot to do with the polar bear, this diesel engine needs a bootful of revs before you can even think about setting off. And then, when you do, you think something is broken because there simply isn’t enough oomph.

It wasn’t seemly for anyone to see the Moric in his nightclothes. It also probably wasn’t particularly seemly for the Moric to be wandering through the hyll in the dead of night, clutching a dagger and sweating through his silky shirt and robe.

I was a cub reporter on parliament duty. Those were the days of the Chelvanayagam debates. Do minorities get 50 per cent or do they get nothing? We Sinhalese knew the Tamils could out-bat, out-screw, out-think, out-everything us. So we gave them nothing. And made some of them hate all of us.
I was rusty already from laying off for so long, and without any boxing—other than what I would be getting up in camp—I would have to go into the ring stale, and I wasn’t going for that. That’s how people get hurt. So I told Nate to call the promoter back and get him to guarantee me some sparring in South America, or I wasn’t going to accept the fight. Nate promised to call and told me to drop back by the club later on that night to find out what was happening. Then I drove John Artis up to the Nite Spot, dropped him off, and Bucks and I went to another club called Richie’s Hideaway. That was where the best band in town was playing that night.
I was swept away, but not unkindly, to some distance, where the people around me made me stay; urging, as I confusedly perceived, that he was bent on going, with help or without, and that I should endanger the precautions for his safety by troubling those with whom they rested. I don’t know what I answered, or what they rejoined; but, I saw hurry on the beach, and men running with ropes from a capstan that was there, and penetrating into a circle of figures that hid him from me. Then, I saw him standing alone, in a seaman’s frock and trowsers: a rope in his hand, or slung to his wrist: another round his body: and several of the best men holding, at a little distance, to the latter, which he laid out himself, slack upon the shore, at his feet.

Let’s see what REM has to say. From your opponent’s point of view, what’s your range? On a flop like this one, it could be pretty wide. You could have a smaller overpair like JJ, TT, or 99. You could have a set or a straight, in which case his queens are in big trouble. You could be semibluffing with a flush draw or a straight draw or both. Or you could be on a stone bluff. Against a set or straight, he has less than 9 percent equity. And against your bluffs and worse overpair hands he could have more than 90 percent.

Little Dorrit would have been glad to make her visit to Mrs Gowan, alone; but as Fanny, who had not yet recovered from her Uncle’s protest, though it was four-and-twenty hours of age, pressingly offered her company, the two sisters stepped together into one of the gondolas under Mr Dorrit’s window, and, with the courier in attendance, were taken in high state to Mrs Gowan’s lodging. In truth, their state was rather too high for the lodging, which was, as Fanny complained, ‘fearfully out of the way,’ and which took them through a complexity of narrow streets of water, which the same lady disparaged as ‘mere ditches.’

Looking at all the cases, it’s easy to see that raising the turn comes out ahead. Calling gives you a small chance of winning another bet when he has no hand or a medium-strength hand. Raising gives a good chance of winning a much larger river bet, or even his whole stack when he has a pretty good hand. Furthermore, raising is especially good with a draw on board since you’re charging him to see a card when he has a draw, and when he doesn’t, he has to consider that you may be semi-bluffing.

Many times you will correctly call on the flop with a drawing hand， miss the turn， and face a big bet. In that situation， you should usually fold， raising only occasionally. Calling is often the worst choice unless your implied odds are good. Don’t cling to weak draws on the turn just because you called on the flop.

I went into a baker’s just to look at the bread. It made me feel  kind o’ good just to look at the bread and cakes, and I thought maybe they  would give me some. I asked ’em  wouldn’t they give me a loaf, and take their  pay in matches. But they said  they’d got enough matches to last three months;  so  there  wasn’t any chance for a trade. While I was standin’ at the stove war-min’ me, the baker went into a back room, and I felt so hungry I thought I  would take just one loaf, and go off with it.

Miss Rugg was a lady of a little property which she had acquired, together with much distinction in the neighbourhood, by having her heart severely lacerated and her feelings mangled by a middle-aged baker resident in the vicinity, against whom she had, by the agency of Mr Rugg, found it necessary to proceed at law to recover damages for a breach of promise of marriage. The baker having been, by the counsel for Miss Rugg, witheringly denounced on that occasion up to the full amount of twenty guineas, at the rate of about eighteen-pence an epithet, and having been cast in corresponding damages, still suffered occasional persecution from the youth of Pentonville. But Miss Rugg, environed by the majesty of the law, and having her damages invested in the public securities, was regarded with consideration.

Mr. Weller’s first act, on hearing this concession, was to despatch Job Trotter to the illustrious Mr. Pell, with an authority to deliver to the bearer the formal discharge which his prudent parent had had the foresight to leave in the hands of that learned gentleman, in case it should be, at any time, required on an emergency; his next proceeding was, to invest his whole stock of ready–money in the purchase of five–and–twenty gallons of mild porter, which he himself dispensed on the racket–ground to everybody who would partake of it; this done, he hurra’d in pers parts of the building until he lost his voice, and then quietly relapsed into his usual collected and philosophical condition.

My lodgings are at a hatter’s—my own hatter’s. After exhibiting no articles in his window for some weeks, but sea-side wide-awakes, shooting-caps, and a choice of rough waterproof head-gear for the moors and mountains, he has put upon the heads of his family as much of this stock as they could carry, and has taken them off to the Isle of Thanet. His young man alone remains—and remains alone in the shop. The young man has let out the fire at which the irons are heated, and, saving his strong sense of duty, I see no reason why he should take the shutters down.
Nanami doesn’t come to the touristy part of Tokyo very often. It’s very busy on such a warm sunny weekend and he does his best to stick close to Gojo as they go with the flow of foot traffic around them, gripping his hand tightly so they don’t get separated. He admittedly regrets not using his scent blocker after all because the absolute cacophony of clashing scents is starting to become a bit overwhelming.
Nanami lifts his hips and fumbles his shorts down, and Gojo helps him tug them the rest of the way off before tossing them away. He throws his own boxers to join them and then presses back between Nanami’s thighs, biting his lip at the sight of him wearing nothing but his jacket.
Naomasa cleared his throat, pulling their attention back to him. Bakugou glanced to the left and watched the retreating backs of Todoroki’s family before allowing Uraraka to pull him into the room. One of the chairs was thrown to the side, presumably Natsuo’s. A number of things could’ve provoked him to lash out, but none of that mattered to Naomasa as he bent over with an exhausted groan to pick up the chair and set it upright.
Naoya was leaned back in his chair, his eyebrows quirked up in an almost mocking expression. Somehow, he had the nerve to look down on Gojo while everyone else was looking up.

He could also have made a straight, a set, or some other hand that beats you. But you’re getting roughly 2-to-1 to call, and you should win this pot more than 1 time in 3.

Notes:  When lifting from the blocks, the pressure on the feet prior to the bar being separated from the blocks will need to be farther back toward the heels than it would be during a lift from the floor when the barbell is at the same height, or in the starting position of a hang power clean from the same starting height.

Notice that an ace on the turn would be much worse for you. A big chunk of his range at this point are medium or low suited aces (and some unsuited aces as well), and you’d have no chance of moving him off a pair of aces.
Notice that the flop includes an ace and one of your suit.  Ifsomeone else bets, you should raise. Now bet on the turn with theintention of just showing down on the river if you do not improve.If you get check-raised on fourth street, you usually should fold,unless you helped or picked up a flush draw. You don't haveenough chance to draw out against a legitimate hand to make itworth calling the check-raise. But if your opponent may be bluffingor semi-bluffing, you've got to keep him honest. Had you notflopped a three-flush with your pair of aces, a raise on the flop is       less likely to be correct. In fact, without the back-door flushpotential, it may be better to fold.
Notice that these are flops where the c-bettor is most likely to be betting with nothing, so a float will have the best chance of winning the pot.
Not only was I on the wrong side of the river to fish with drowned stone flies, but Paul was a good enough roll caster to have already fished most of my side from his own. But I caught two more. They also started as little circles that looked like little fish feeding on the surface but were broken arches of big rainbows under water. After I caught these two, I quit. They made ten, and the last three were the finest fish I ever caught. They weren't the biggest or most spectacular fish I ever caught, but they were three fish I caught because my brother waded across the river to give me the fly that would catch them and because they were the last fish I ever caught fishing with him.
Not to you and me it isn’t. Because the 911 stands out as a very real way of experiencing a little bit of genuine sports motoring for a fraction of the cost of buying a Ferrari and with far fewer histrionics. And, these days, less of a tendency to end up in a hedge.

Truly, said Beaumains, he may well be a good knight, but he useth shameful customs, and it is marvel that he endureth so long that none of the noble knights of my lord Arthur’s have not dealt with him.
Now, please understand that making every single recipe in this book worthy of lamination is, uh, a tall order, the cause of a dozen gray hairs, and unequivocally the reason I took five years (and a few begged-for weeks) to finish this book.

If it pays off, and if you find a few keepers here for your forever files, I will soar over the tall buildings around me with glee.

Now you may be thinking， “Yes， but if he had a flush draw he still hit the flush.” That’s true， but he paid $120 on the turn to get there， and he’ll miss that river flush over 80 percent of the time. On average， you’ll win a lot of money.

Once there was a second leg up (bar 14 had a higher high, so it was clearly a  small second leg), any bar that had a low below the prior bar was a low 2 short.  Bar 15 turned into a low 2 short signal bar even though it was a small swing  high that was below the high of the two legs up (it was a lower high in what  should be expected to be at least two legs down). Also, as discussed in the next chapter, bar 15 was also a wedge bear flag entry based on three pushes up  where bar 14 was the third push up and the two bull trend bars before bar 13  were the first two pushes up.

The man within was inclined to give them admittance, and was indeed about to do so, when a stout gentleman with a long whip in his hand, and a flushed face which seemed to indicate that he had had his morning’s draught, rode up to the gate, and called in a loud voice and with more oaths than the occasion seemed to warrant to have it opened directly.
One drawback to the free card play is that, when successful,it can give your hand away. Specifically, suppose you raise theflop, but then check the turn. If the flop contained a two-flush, itwill be obvious to your observant opponents that you are likely tohave a flush draw. If they are also on a draw, they may bet as abluff if the river is a blank.

That hope deferred, which, (as the Scripture very correctly tells us, Mr Dombey would have added in a patronising way; for his highest distinct idea even of Scripture, if examined, would have been found to be; that as forming part of a general whole, of which Dombey and Son formed another part, it was therefore to be commended and upheld) maketh the heart sick.

Our gentle lady has, unfortunately, an unfaithful friend in the knave of diamonds; and he is followed by the ace of diamonds, reversed, which portends a letter on the way containing bad news. The writer of this is a dark young man of no social position, and he probably is the servant of one who is dear to the queen of diamonds. The bad news is found in the next count, the nine of spades, which tells of sickness affecting the king of clubs, the warm-hearted, chivalrous man who occupies the first place in the inquirer’s affections. The last count but one brings us to the ten of spades, reversed, by which we know that the lady’s sorrow will be but brief; and it is followed by the ace of hearts, a love letter containing the good news of her lover’s recovery.
Out in the kitchen long Dave Regan grabbed, from the far side of the table, where he had thrown it, a burst and battered concertina, which he had been for the last hour vainly trying to patch and make air-tight; and, holding it out towards the back-door, between his palms, as a football is held, he let it drop, and fetched it neatly on the toe of his riding-boot. It was a beautiful kick, the concertina shot out into the blackness, from which was projected, in return, first a short, sudden howl, then a face with one eye glaring and the other covered by an enormous brick-coloured hand, and a voice that wanted to know who shot ‘that lurid loaf of bread?’
Out upon the angry wind! how from sighing, it began to bluster round the merry forge, banging at the wicket, and grumbling in the chimney, as if it bullied the jolly bellows for doing anything to order. And what an impotent swaggerer it was too, for all its noise; for if it had any influence on that hoarse companion, it was but to make him roar his cheerful song the louder, and by consequence to make the fire burn the brighter, and the sparks to dance more gayly yet; at length, they whizzed so madly round and round, that it was too much for such a surly wind to bear; so off it flew with a howl giving the old sign before the ale–house door such a cuff as it went, that the Blue Dragon was more rampant than usual ever afterwards, and indeed, before Christmas, reared clean out of its crazy frame.

Paired flops share many of the characteristics of dry flops meaning that few hands connect with it. So if the cutoff didn’t start with a pair, he probably doesn’t have two pair now. In addition, he can’t have a flush draw or a straight draw. Thus, your modest pair of sixes is likely to be the best hand.

Puddleshine looked up from the moss he was pressing into a nest at the back of the den. “Do you have everything you need?”       Shadowsight looked through the herbs bundled into the wrap, his heart sinking. There were hardly enough leaves to treat one wound, and Ashfur had plenty. Why had Mothwing been so stingy? With the long days ofgreenleaf ahead, there was no shortage of herbs. Did she want Ashfur to suffer? He pushed the thought away. Mothwing was a medicine cat. She’d never want any cat to suffer. Perhaps she didn’t realize how badly Tigerstar and Hawkwing had wounded him. He blinked at Puddleshine. “I could use some moremarigold.”

Quiet being again restored, a delicious half-hour—so Frank called it, in the course of subsequent conversation with Tim Linkinwater as they were walking home—was spent in conversation, and Tim's watch at length apprising him that it was high time to depart, the ladies were left alone, though not without many offers on the part of Frank to remain until Nicholas arrived, no matter what hour of the night it might be, if, after the late neighbourly irruption, they entertained the least fear of being left to themselves. As their freedom from all further apprehension, however, left no pretext for his insisting on mounting guard, he was obliged to abandon the citadel, and to retire with the trusty Tim.

Raising is certainly possible here with your top pair, top kicker, but if he reraises, you’re in a difficult spot. You can’t really lay your hand down, but if he does have an overpair or an eight, it’s going to cost a lot of money early in the tournament.

Reason to Bet No. 6: Before the “cooler” comes. Another reason for betting into a potential drawing hand is that your opponent may not, in fact, have a drawing hand. Here’s an example.

Scenario No. 2. Same situation except the limper and the checkraiser both have you covered. It’s $50 to you, and you have $967. You don’t want to raise $917 more all-in because you will only get called when you are way behind, and there’s not enough money in the pot to make such an aggressive move worthwhile. With only $67 left in Scenario No. 1, getting all-in was almost a foregone conclusion. Not so now. An all-in move would be reckless.

She asked it so anxiously, that if he had been in possession of any kind of tenement, he would have had it plastered a foot deep rather than answer No. But he was obliged to answer No; and he saw a shade of disappointment on her face, as she checked a sigh, and looked at the low fire. Then he saw, also, that Mrs Plornish was a young woman, made somewhat slatternly in herself and her belongings by poverty; and so dragged at by poverty and the children together, that their united forces had already dragged her face into wrinkles.
She did not. She continued to sit there, practically gouging a hole in his shoulder with her nails with how hard she was gripping him.
She didn’t know if it was or not, but she could afford it, with the spheres she had, even if most of them were dun.
She folded her arms. “Devious of you. Well, get to it.” It was unlikely she’d be able to go through with this without the captain finding out anyway.
She got going real fast real quick—so fast it was hard to control herself as she relaxed her awesomeness and tried to leap to her feet. She crashed into the wall at the end of the hallway instead, a sprawling heap of limbs.
She is so conscious of his looking at her with a gloating admiration of the touch of anger on her, and the fire and animation it brings with it, that even as her spirit rises, it falls again, and she struggles with a sense of shame, affront, and fear, much as she did that night at the piano.
She knew that Bakugou was going to snap just from the way his eyes flashed and he ripped the microphone out of the offending reporter’s hands. The camera zoomed in on him, the video of the fight falling to the wayside.

Since there is no turn card that will make you consider folding, just check and see if one of the other two players will try to take down the pot. If an innocuous card comes on the turn and both players check again, just check to the river and give them one last chance. With top set, your goal should be to double your stack, not just pick up the existing pot.

SIR, said the damosel Linet unto Sir Beaumains, look ye be glad and light, for yonder is your deadly enemy, and at yonder window is my lady, my sister, Dame Lionesse. Where? said Beaumains. Yonder, said the damosel, and pointed with her finger. That is truth, said Beaumains. She beseemeth afar the fairest lady that ever I looked upon; and truly, he said, I ask no better quarrel than now for to do battle, for truly she shall be my lady, and for her I will fight. And ever he looked up to the window with glad countenance, and the Lady Lionesse made curtsey to him down to the earth, with holding up both their hands.

A door to the bedroom: a door by my bed to the hallway: in the wall at the foot of my bed, a square window, shuttered; another in the wall next at right angles. On the floor beneath this window, a small trunk. To its left, stood across the corner, a bureau and mirror. To its right, stood across the corner, a sewing machine:

So Clemency, shaking his proffered hand, said she would; and Britain, who had been terribly cast down at sight of his despondent wife (which was like the business hanging its head), said that was right; and Mr. Snitchey and Michael Warden went up–stairs; and there they were soon engaged in a conversation so cautiously conducted, that no murmur of it was audible above the clatter of plates and dishes, the hissing of the frying–pan, the bubbling of saucepans, the low monotonous waltzing of the jack—with a dreadful click every now and then as if it had met with some mortal accident to its head, in a fit of giddiness—and all the other preparations in the kitchen for their dinner.

Something that was not all oil here shining in Lamps's eye, Barbox Brothers withdrew his own a little disconcerted, looked at the fire, and put a foot on the top bar.

So our ace-king suited is well ahead of both player’s ranges, and our proper play is to move all-in. There’s some chance that this action will make the 3-bettor fold, and we’ll be left against the original raiser with a ton of dead money in the pot. If not, we’ll at least be all-in in a situation where we dominate one opponent and have a coin flip against the other, a pretty good outcome at this stage of the tournament.

Spain is so many things. It’s mountains and deserts and wearing tight trousers while you stab a bull. It’s clubs that stay open until dawn, pounding the night with a pulsating beat that only makes any sense if you’ve ingested a bucketful of what, the other day, I mistakenly called MDF.
Specifically, moving all-in is reasonable given his stack size, but a better play is to 3-bet to something in the range of 20,000 to 25,000. This gives him the chance to come over the top with an all-in 4-bet which might appear to have some fold equity. You’ll then call, of course.

Still, in spite of everything he had, till recently, done well enough. Money was loose, and the diggers, if given long credit when down on their luck, were in the main to be relied on to pay up when they struck the lead or tapped a pocket. He had had slack seasons before now, and things had always come right again. This made it hard for him to explain the present prolonged spell of dullness.
Still so recoiling in her chair that her overpoised weight moved it, from time to time, a little on its wheels, and gave her the appearance of a phantom of fierce aspect gliding away from him, she interposed her left arm, bent at the elbow with the back of her hand towards her face, between herself and him, and looked at him in a fixed silence.

That doesn’t happen any more.

That’s a good flop and your hand is now top pair with the secondbest kicker. The cutoff checks and you bet 2,200 which is just over half the pot. With no draws available on this board, it seems likely you’ll take the pot down right here, but your opponent calls. The pot is now 8,450 and the effective stack is 24,000.
That’s a good flop. You’ve hit a flush draw and there are no high cards to connect with a Broadway hand. It’s also unlikely your opponent connected with this flop, although he may have started with a pair and still feel good about his hand.
That’s called a “fork.” I love the look on his face when I manage one of those and take his bishop. Like it hurts a little, but he likes it, too.
That’s not an exhaustive list, but the lesson is that there are lots of hands that might call on this board, and two opponents, either of whom could make that call.
That’s the giveaway, really. This car was built to look good in a brochure. The numbers and ingredients are tantalizing, but this car is not a serious player in the European theatre of war.

But it’s not nice to drive.
The 10th arcanum, the first hour of the series, corresponds with the stage which man has reached at the present time. The symbol of this arcanum is the Sphinx, which guarded the entrance to the Egyptian world; the Neophyte descended between its paws into the tunnel which led to the sanctuary, through a series of tests, the image and novitiate of the descent which we have just mentioned.
The air was cold, Tom; so it was, there was no denying it; but would it have been more genial in the gig? The blacksmith’s fire burned very bright, and leaped up high, as though it wanted men to warm; but would it have been less tempting, looked at from the clammy cushions of a gig? The wind blew keenly, nipping the features of the hardy wight who fought his way along; blinding him with his own hair if he had enough to it, and wintry dust if he hadn’t; stopping his breath as though he had been soused in a cold bath; tearing aside his wrappings–up, and whistling in the very marrow of his bones; but it would have done all this a hundred times more fiercely to a man in a gig, wouldn’t it? A fig for gigs!

The publication of Lévi’s Dogme et Rituel must, I think, have impressed Vaillant very much, and although in this, which was the writer’s most important work, the anecdote that I have mentioned is practically his only Tarot reference, he seems to have gone much further in a later publication—Clef Magique de la Fiction et du Fait, but I have not been able to see it, nor do I think, from the reports concerning it, that I have sustained a loss.
The Balestra Mate is similar to Boden's Mate, but instead of two bishops, a bishop and a queen is used. The bishop delivers the checkmate, while the queen blocks the remaining escape squares.

The chief music-master went off to Ts’i. Kan, the conductor of the music at the second repast, went over to Ts’u. Liáu, conductor at the third repast, went over to Ts’ai. And Kiueh, who conducted at the fourth, went to Ts’in.
The Commanders’ short-week letdown came in prime time and in front of a third consecutive sellout crowd at FedEx Field. While Bears Coach Matt Eberflus entered the night with a scorching hot seat, Thursday’s loss raises serious questions about the direction the Commanders are headed in five games into Coach Ron Rivera’s fourth year at the helm. Washington hasn’t had a winning record through five weeks since 2018.

The deceased lady Li, the wife of Ximen, was born at noon on the fifteenth day of the first month in the year Xinwei of the reign Yuanyu, and died at midnight on the seventeenth day of the ninth month in the year Dingyu of the reign Zhenghe. This was a Bingzi day, and the order of the month Wuzu, Her spirit is ten feet high. It will be useless to wail for her until the mourning dress has been worn. And, when she is put into her coffin, none should be present whose animal is the Dragon, the Tiger, the Cock, or the Snake, unless he is a kinsman.
The definition presented here is known as a recursive definition, for the reason that inside the definiens, the definiendum is used. This is a fancy way of saying that I appear to be defining something in terms of itself, which ought to be considered gauche if not downright circular in anyone's book! To see whether the Lisp genie looks askance upon such trickery, let's ask it to figure out (power 9 3): Î (power 9 3)

The fifth pack, consisting of only two cards (the ace of hearts and the nine of diamonds), is for the surprise, and we learn that a love letter, the ace, will be delayed, the nine; but the consolation card is the king of clubs, the dark, warm-hearted man, who will come in person to his lady-love.
The first contestant was stunned, "My first half can be read in parts, and can be repeated in a cyclic manner. Shuǐ chù míng, shān chù xiù, shuǐ shān chù chù míng xiù! (Clear is the water, gorgeous are the mountains, the lake and mountains are clear and gorgeous everywhere!)"
The flop gave you good implied odds with a draw to the nut flush, two people behind you, and plenty of money left to bet. The turn increased your outs. In addition to nine cards to make a flush, you gained six cards that give you a straight. (Three more cards, the aces, could make you the winner as well.) However, because you have only one opponent left, and you think that he has a top pair hand, your implied odds have fallen. If the third diamond hits, or if the river makes you a one-card straight, it’s unlikely your opponent will pay you anything.
The flop has, of course, completely missed your hand. However, you can’t open with a pair of fives in early position if the plan is to give up when you don’t flop a set or hit a straight draw. Those flops are just bonuses. So be prepared to fight for and win some pots that don’t connect with your hand. Here’s a perfect example.

their mobilization across the cleft at the level of the poste-rior nasal spine. The ﬁrst is the greater palatine pedicle, and       the second is the abnormal attachment of the levator veli pala-tini and tensor palatini muscles to the posterior hard palate.       A number of techniques have been described for lengthening       of the pedicle, including osteotomies of the foramen. Sharp re-lease of the periosteal sheath of the pedicle allows the pedicle       to be stretched without compromising perfusion of the ﬂaps.       With the pedicle on stretch, a beaver blade is placed behind the       pedicle at the edge of the hard palate. The periosteal sheath       is lightly stroked until the underlying perivascular fat starts to       herniate, at which point the incision follows the length of the       pedicle along the long axis of the ﬂap.

THE LOVER, OR LIBERTY—The sixth day is one of pride; it was that of the birth of Lamech, who said to his wives: “I have slain a man to my own hurt, and a stripling to my own bruising. Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain, but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold.” This day is propitious to conspiracies and revolts.
The lows of bar 18, bar 19, and the bar after bar 20 formed three pushes  down. The high of the doji bar after bar 18, the bull bar after bar 19, and bar  20 formed three pushes up and created a triangle. Bar 23 was the pullback  from the bar 22 breakout above the triangle.

The moral: don’t overdo the double-barrel bluffs early when the blinds are small. But make them a bigger part of your game as you get deeper into the tournament.
Then came King Anguish unto Tramtrist, and asked him why he would not joust. Sir, he said, I was but late hurt, and as yet I dare not adventure me. Then came there the same squire that was sent from the king’s daughter of France unto Sir Tristram. And when he had espied Sir Tristram he fell flat to his feet. All that espied La Beale Isoud, what courtesy the squire made unto Sir Tristram. And therewithal suddenly Sir Tristram ran unto his squire, whose name was Hebes le Renoumes, and prayed him heartily in no wise to tell his name. Sir, said Hebes, I will not discover your name but if ye command me.
The net result is that check-raising shows a slight edge over betting if your opponent has a flush, but betting is a big winner if he has a straight, set, or two pair. The two plays are a wash if he has a weaker hand than that. However, the straights, sets, and two-pair hands are his most likely holdings given the betting action thus far, so leading out with a bet is the right idea. This result is typical for playing a very strong hand on the river — the gains from checking and trapping your opponent into making a bet he wouldn’t have made otherwise are washed out by the lost bets if the hand is checked down and he would have called a bet.
The next bustle brought in Mr. Campbell, the surgeon of the Thrush, a very well-behaved young man, who came to call for his friend, and for whom there was with some contrivance found a chair, and with some hasty washing of the young tea-maker's, a cup and saucer; and after another quarter of an hour of earnest talk between the gentlemen, noise rising upon noise, and bustle upon bustle, men and boys at last all in motion together, the moment came for setting off; everything was ready, William took leave, and all of them were gone; for the three boys, in spite of their mother's entreaty, determined to see their brother and Mr. Campbell to the sally-port; and Mr. Price walked off at the same time to carry back his neighbour's newspaper.

The next pack, standing for “The House,” is made up of the knave of spades, the ace of spades, the king of spades, and the knave of hearts. We will take their significations as they stand. The three spades mean disappointment. The presence of two knaves together speaks of evil intentions. The legal agent, knave of spades, is employed in some underhand business by his master, king of spades, the dishonest lawyer, who is an enemy to the inquirer just as he is that of her friend, the festive, thoughtless young bachelor, knave of hearts, who follows him.
Then in great wrath they departed with their horses, and came together as it had been the thunder, and the Black Knight’s spear brake, and Beaumains thrust him through both his sides, and therewith his spear brake, and the truncheon left still in his side. But nevertheless the Black Knight drew his sword, and smote many eager strokes, and of great might, and hurt Beaumains full sore. But at the last the Black Knight, within an hour and an half, he fell down off his horse in swoon, and there he died. And when Beaumains saw him so well horsed and armed, then he alighted down and armed him in his armour, and so took his horse and rode after the damosel.
Then the horn sounded and I spurred Hawk, “For God, England, and Prince Harry!” The men all cheered and we rode through the narrow gaps left by the archers. They were only three men deep and we burst before the archers. They would concentrate their arrows on the centre of the Welsh line as soon as we had cleared their front. The Welsh knights and mounted men at arms were less than a hundred and fifty paces from us. They had been caught unawares for they must have thought the three lines of archers precluded a mounted attack. They began to charge but, from a standing start, they would hit us at the walk whilst we, although not in a line of riders boot to boot, would hit them at the gallop for already Hawk’s legs had opened and he was eating up the ground.
Then when Priamus the good knight perceived the great fight, he went to Sir Gawaine, and bade him that he should go and succour his fellowship, which were sore bestead with their enemies. Sir, grieve you not, said Sir Gawaine, for their gree shall be theirs. I shall not once move my horse to them ward, but if I see more than there be; for they be strong enough to match them.
Then you get up on a stepladder and begin to dig it out with some very long shovels, transferring the gook into a wheelbarrow. And while you’re doing this, and everyone involved is saying things like “Gross,” “Grody,” “Jessuz freaking Christ,” “Funkee,” “Uhhhh!,” and “Dag!,” and “Watch where you’re tossing that!,” “Oh this is for real!,” and “Holy mama mia!,” you can’t help but have an appreciation for how very special and wonderful modern flushing toilets—“inodoros” my mother called them—really are.
The Oddity crashed down behind him, almost on his heels now by the sound of it. With the length of its jumps being what they were, it was a miracle it wasn't on him already.
The opposite is true in three-push bottoms, where the second of the two legs  can often be seen as breaking into two parts and you have what appears to be a  high 3 but functions like a wedge and like a high 2. In other words, the market  should go up for at least a scalp, regardless of how you choose to number the  legs.

The question was how to decipher it? The period might separate the words, as it appeared. Or it could mean something else, like a starting point, or a stand-in for a comma or an apostrophe. It might even be nothing, a distraction to throw a would-be spy down the wrong path. End swords. Sword’s end. End’s words. Send words. Send them? Send them where?

There are a couple of non-standard preflop plays with aces and kings that are worth mentioning. The first is limping in early position with the intention of reraising after someone raises you. This play once had a little bite, but it’s been around so long that everyone knows it. With 3-betting so common, you’ll make more money with your premium hands by just raising and reraising after someone 3-bets you.
The recollections, too, with which they made merry over that long protracted tea! The glee with which the locksmith asked Joe if he remembered that stormy night at the Maypole when he first asked after Dolly—the laugh they all had, about that night when she was going out to the party in the sedan-chair—the unmerciful manner in which they rallied Mrs Varden about putting those flowers outside that very window—the difficulty Mrs Varden found in joining the laugh against herself, at first, and the extraordinary perception she had of the joke when she overcame it—the confidential statements of Joe concerning the precise day and hour when he was first conscious of being fond of Dolly, and Dolly’s blushing admissions, half volunteered and half extorted, as to the time from which she dated the discovery that she ‘didn’t mind’ Joe—here was an exhaustless fund of mirth and conversation.

there is a bear channel and a large bull bar forms, this breakout bar has  a high and close that are above the highs and closes of five or even 20 or  more bars. A large number of bars reversed by the close of the bull bar is  a stronger sign than a similar number of bars reversed by only its high.

There was no time to inquire to what this exclamation, which was delivered in a very rapturous tone, referred; for he had already thrown open the door of the room; into which Nicholas, followed by Smike with the bundle on his shoulder (he carried it about with him as vigilantly as if it had been a sack of gold), straightway repaired.

There was someone else in front of him, large and bright, orange like fire, and Bakugou grumbled, “Turn off your quirk, Half and Half…” before remembering that Todoroki was gone and then he fell forward into nothing, sagging completely in Kirishima’s hold as the last of the adrenaline left his body. The last thing he thought of was the look on Uraraka’s brave face and scared eyes, as if she telling him that she had to do it. She had to save him.
There was so much of the world—even of the little world of the country girl—in this idea of the old milliner, that Kate, who was anxious, for every reason, to change the subject, made no further remark, and left Miss Knag in possession of the field.
There were even black crescents under her fingernails. There was nothing of quality folks about Cathleen now. She looked Cracker, even worse. She looked poor white, shiftless, slovenly, trifling.“She’ll be dipping snuff soon, if she isn’t doing it already,” thought Scarlett in horror. “GoodLord! What a comedown!”       She shuddered, turning her eyes from Cathleen as she realized how narrow was the chasm between quality folk and poor whites.“There but for a lot of gumption am I,” she thought, and pride surged through her as she realized that she and Cathleen had started with the same equipment after the surrender— empty hands and what they had in their heads.
There were four or five taxis parked at the curb, in snow that was now swirling instead of just spitting. I got into the first one, relishing the warm breath from the heater. The cabbie turned around, a fat guy with a badge reading LICENSED LIVERY on his battered cap. He was a complete stranger to me, but I knew that when he turned on the radio, it would be tuned to WJAB out of Portland, and when he dragged his ciggies out of his breast pocket, they would be Lucky Strikes. What goes around comes around.
Therewith he quickly bound up his doublet with his girdle, and went his way to the styes, where the tribes of the swine were penned. Thence he took and brought forth two, and sacrificed them both, and singed them and cut them small, and spitted them. And when he had roasted all, he bare and set it by Odysseus, all hot as it was upon the spits, and he sprinkled thereupon white barley-meal. Then in a bowl of ivywood he mixed the honey-sweet wine, and himself sat over against him and bade him fall to:

The rock thing — which has become a grim bit of mythopoeia now trotted out to illustrate how cushy the present Ennet residents have it — was probably not as whacko as it seemed to Division of S.A.S., since many of the things veteran AA’s ask newcomers to do and believe seem not much less whacko than trying to chew feldspar.

The second pack—for the house—contains a flush of diamonds, the ten, the ace, and the knave. There is plenty of money in the house: the ten speaks of a journey, possibly resulting in a change of residence; the ace, being reversed, tells of a letter on the way containing unpleasant news (probably connected with the removal), from the knave, who is a faithless friend, and is to blame for the annoyance.
These innocent MacStingers were so many daggers to the Captain's breast, when they appeared in a swarm, and tore at him with the confiding trustfulness he so little deserved. The eye of Alexander MacStinger, who had been his favourite, was insupportable to the Captain; the voice of Juliana MacStinger, who was the picture of her mother, made a coward of him.

These relations are illustrated graphically in Figure 9.1. A NAND gate is equivalent to an         OR of inverted inputs. A NOR gate is equivalent to an AND of inverted inputs. The         same relationship applies to gates with more inputs. Switching between these representa-         tions is easy to do on a whiteboard and is often called         bubble pushing         .

The stare of indignant wonder with which Young Barnacle accompanied this disclosure, would have strained his eyes injuriously but for the opportune relief of dinner. Mr Meagles (who had been extremely solicitous to know how his uncle and aunt were) begged him to conduct Mrs Meagles to the dining-room. And when he sat on Mrs Meagles’s right hand, Mr Meagles looked as gratified as if his whole family were there.
The table lookup decoding method using the syndrome is practical only when n−k is small, e.g., when n − k &lt; 10. This method is impractical for many interesting and powerful codes. For example, if n −k = 20, the table has 220 (approximately 1 million)
The tendency of mankind when it falls asleep in coaches, is to wake up cross; to find its legs in its way; and its corns an aggravation. Mr Pecksniff not being exempt from the common lot of humanity found himself, at the end of his nap, so decidedly the victim of these infirmities, that he had an irresistible inclination to visit them upon his daughters; which he had already begun to do in the shape of pers random kicks, and other unexpected motions of his shoes, when the coach stopped, and after a short delay the door was opened.
The thing is though, Nanami doesn’t want to run away anymore. Not from his work, or jujutsu, or curses, and he certainly doesn’t want to run away from Gojo.

We could  hear the water hissing on it like it was red hot.

The woman looked, first at Nicholas, and then at Mr Mantalini, as if uncertain on whom to visit this extraordinary behaviour; but Mr Mantalini happening by ill-luck to thrust his nose from under the bedclothes, in his anxiety to ascertain whether the visitors were gone, she suddenly, and with a dexterity which could only have been acquired by long practice, flung a pretty heavy clothes-basket at him, with so good an aim that he kicked more violently than before, though without venturing to make any effort to disengage his head, which was quite extinguished. Thinking this a favourable opportunity for departing before any of the torrent of her wrath discharged itself upon him, Nicholas hurried Kate off, and left the unfortunate subject of this unexpected recognition to explain his conduct as he best could.

Back at the house they shared another pot of tea – mostly silently – before he disappeared into the cellar. Having been given leave to peruse his bookshelves, save the warded one adjacent to the front window, she chose a volume and then stretched out on the sofa to read.
The younger sister raised her head, and, for a moment, turned it. Then, turning back again, and fully meeting, for the first time, those calm eyes, fell sobbing on her neck.
They’re game for an all-out offensive and they’ll settle for an evenhanded beef. But in this instance, the D.C. boys are playing with certain advantages. For one thing, they’re from somewhere else, so there’s little possibility of setting up on them, getting a drop at this address or that. For another, they’re apparently mobile, rolling around in that Acura.
They start working on the business where they start working in the business.
They win many small- to medium-sized pots by making top pairand having it hold up (and occasionally by holding upunimproved). Sometimes, when they make a pair on the flop, youhave to “play defense”from that point on. They do not improveoften enough, so you hope to survive the turn and river againstdrawing opponents. If an opponent draws out, he will use the bigbets on the turn and river to punish the, now, second-best top pairhand. Thus, these hands make lots of money on the early bettingrounds, preflop and flop, when they are favored to win. On laterrounds, drawing opponents fold when they miss, but raise whenthey make their hands. The drawing hands usually have theadvantage on the turn and river.24
The Zâu-yü is expressive of joy that every office is (rightly) filled; the Lî-shâu is expressive of the joy at audiences of the court; the Zhâi-pin is expressive of the joy in observing the laws (which have been learned); and the Zhâi-fân is expressive of the joy in being free from all failures in duty. Therefore the son of Heaven regulated his shooting by keeping in his mind the right feeling of all officers; a feudal prince, by keeping in his mind the times of his appearing before the son of Heaven; a dignitary, being a Great officer, by keeping in his mind the observing of the laws (which he had learned); and an officer, by keeping in his mind that he must not fail in the duties of his office.

This being purely a labour of love, Mr Squeers readily complied, and leaving the room for the purpose, almost immediately returned, supporting a sleek personage with an oily face, who, bursting from him, and giving to view the form and face of Mr Snawley, made straight up to Smike, and tucking that poor fellow's head under his arm in a most uncouth and awkward embrace, elevated his broad- brimmed hat at arm's length in the air as a token of devout thanksgiving, exclaiming, meanwhile, 'How little did I think of this here joyful meeting, when I saw him last! Oh, how little did I think it!'
This changed the client’s half-formed design of remaining at the coffee-shop until the nondescript should bring him word that Dorrit had issued forth into the street. He entrusted the nondescript with a confidential message to her, importing that the visitor who had waited on her father last night, begged the favour of a few words with her at her uncle’s lodging; he obtained from the same source full directions to the house, which was very near; dismissed the nondescript gratified with half-a-crown; and having hastily refreshed himself at the coffee-shop, repaired with all speed to the clarionet-player’s dwelling.

This is a fair number of times to hang out with your boyfriend and withhold judgment.
This is a good but not a great blend. I know it's very popular and it has a nice nic hit to it, but it's a little to bland and hrsh for my tastes and it seemed to get a little bitter towards the last 3rd of the bowl. It needs a little more perique in...  my opinion as well.
This is a good place to check. You have a hand (top pair, weak kicker) which has good value in a small pot. If you check and the big blind bets the turn, it’s an easy call. But if you bet and get raised, your situation becomes very uncomfortable, with a big pot already and the chance of getting very big on the turn.
This is a total boss blazer- the cut is a little boxy and oversized but in a cool way. It doesn’t look like one of those

This is the full length of the case, from the top lugs to the bottom lugs.
This line is supposedly designed for cellaring, and the side of the tin gives the 'estimated peak' of this tobacco as 10-15 years. I thought I'd try it now, since I love Perique and have been known to smoke it straight. Right now, this stuff is incre... dibly harsh. I cannot recommend it right out of the tin. What would it be like in 10-15 years? Beats me. I'm turning 50 soon and don't have that kind of patience anymore. EDIT: Gave it a second try after jarring it for two months, and it's earned an additional star. Why? I smoked it in a larger bowl, and the first half of the bowl was actually quite enjoyable. And then the harshness kicked in again and it became unsmokeable for me. Perhaps I've become spoiled by VaPers that burn almost down to nothing.
This may be a big ask, but do yourself a favor and read on from a place of faith that you can get to that place of enjoyment with such a dry topic. Bookkeeping, accounting, and financial reporting can be and will become your allies, your friends in the foxhole, and anything but the enemy that they may currently seem to be.
This play of check-calling the flop then betting on the turn is called the “stop and go.” It’s a great play in situations like this one.
This ramshackle bar is a crossroads in every sense, from its location at one of Mae Hong Son’s main intersections to a clientele that ranges from wet-behind-the-ears backpackers to hardened locals. There’s a menu of Thai and Western standards and a pool table upstairs.
This seems all very reasonable. But the trouble is that the calculated numerical factor whereby the bare value must be scaled up, in relation to the dressed value, tuns out to be inWnity! This inWnity can be clearly identiWed as one of the inWnities in the quantum electrodynamical calculation (basically diagrams like that of Fig. 26.9a and elaborations of it). One may take the view that according to some future theory, the divergent integrals should be replaced by something Wnite, perhaps because there is a ‘cut-oV’ coming in at very small distances, i.e. to very large momenta (§21.11), and the correct renormalization factor should be some rather

This was likewise carried to Charity, who talked and smiled next evening in her most engaging manner, and rallying Mr Moddle on the lowness of his spirits, challenged him to play a rubber at cribbage. Mr Moddle taking up the gauntlet, they played several rubbers for sixpences, and Charity won them all. This may have been partially attributable to the gallantry of the youngest gentleman, but it was certainly referable to the state of his feelings also; for his eyes being frequently dimmed by tears, he thought that aces were tens, and knaves queens, which at times occasioned some confusion in his play.

Thus it is well seen that Sigi has slain the thrall and murdered him; so he is given forth to be a wolf in holy places,注134 and may no more abide in the land with his father; therewith Odin bare him fellowship from the land, so long a way, that right long it was, and made no stay till he brought him to certain war-ships. So Sigi falls to lying out a-warring with the strength that his father gave him or ever they parted; and happy was he in his warring, and ever prevailed, till he brought it about that he won by his wars land and lordship at the last; and thereupon he took to him a noble wife, and became a great and mighty king, and ruled over the land of the Huns, and was the greatest of warriors. He had a son by his wife, who was called Rerir, who grew up in his father's house, and soon became great of growth, and shapely.

Toward the latter part of the afternoon, however, the regular northwest wind, as usual, set in, which brought in our studding-sails, and gave us the chance of beating round the Point, which we were now just abreast of, and which stretched off into the Pacific, high, rocky and barren, forming the central point of the coast for hundreds of miles north and south. A cap-full of wind will be a bag-full here, and before night our royals were furled, and the ship was laboring hard under her top-gallant sails. At eight bells our watch went below, leaving her with as much sail as she could stagger under, the water flying over the forecastle at every plunge. It was evidently blowing harder, but then there was not a cloud in the sky, and the sun had gone down bright.

Trucy shouted for him to come back, and she went so far as to run out of the room and drag him back. He looked borderline annoyed when he’d adjusted his shirt and squared Phoenix with a look. He wasn’t sure what it meant.

Upon reaching UA and sliding out of the car, Uraraka noticed Bakugou wince almost imperceptibly, but when she put a hand on his arm and gave him a look of concern, he shrugged her off. Hurt flashed across her face and he caught it before she could get rid of it. He let out an aggravated huff and his face didn't soften in the slightest, but he cupped her chin in one of his calloused hands and nodded his head, somehow letting her know with those two very brief actions that he was fine and appreciated her checking on him. All too quickly, the moment was over and he pulled his hand away, so fast it was like it never happened.

Very few of these hands will connect with a dry flop. No flush draws or straight draws are possible, and unless the caller started with a pair, he probably still doesn’t have one. The caller may also suspect that you missed the flop as well, but since you probably started with a better hand, it’s too difficult for him to play on after you bet.

Vincent barely heard the door close and lock behind him over the pounding of his own heart in his chest. Lucrecia was still alive. Head of the Science Department, from the sound of things. This boy -- Lucrecia had done this. To him. To both of them. And Hojo -- he was still involved in this as well? The first child, the one she'd had with Hojo, must not have made it to term. That must have been why the project was still running. The boy -- he was Series 3, it all made sense now. But Lucrecia couldn't have been his mother, could she? He had mentioned a mother quite frequently all those years ago. She did not seem like Lucrecia, and the boy looked nothing like her nor Hojo. This boy had simply been fallout.
Violetshine blinked, relieved he was with her, and climbed after him. Her heart lurched as her pads slipped on the wet bark. She wobbled. Having a bellyful of kits is throwing off my balance, she realized. Digging her claws in, she steadied herself. She fixed her gaze on Tree and began to follow. Her heart lurched again as the bridge trembled. Lizardtail and Hootwhisker had leaped on behind. Violetshine stopped and looked back, bracing herself against the wind, as she checked to see if they’d found their footing. In single file, they padded after her, their whiskers stiff with concentration. She looked forward once more, swallowing as she glimpsed white water thundering beneath her.

WANDS—As a matter of fact, curiously enough, all authors agree in naming wands or clubs in the first place. In our set of playing-cards the figurative symbol for it is the trefoil (French trèfle)—tri-folio—and Mr. Ouspensky draws the wands bearing leaves which in many instances appear to be threefold—at least they should be. The trefoil or shamrock has always been considered a luck-charm, Porte-bonheur.1 It is built upon the scheme of the triangle, symbol of Trinity, and the totality of the figure appears also in the masonic “trefoil,” which is an emblem of the Divine Trinity together with the principle of activity, indicated by the staff or wand itself, eventually crossed as in the ancient emblem.

Weak draws — two overcards to the board, an overcard plus a gutshot straight draw, or a backdoor flush draw. They’re typically hard to play because they have some value, and you’d rather not be bet off the hand; but the easiest way to win is to make a c-bet and hope your opponent goes away.

We can then continue the distribution of our cards upon this surface in the following way. The head of each partial Trinity will be in division 1; each second term will be in division 2; each third term in division 3. Consequently our IVth card (the Emperor, ח) will be in I.; the Vth card (the Pope, יִ) will be in II.; the VIth card (Liberty, ח) will be in III., and this second sequence will form a new zone upon the sphere. A third, a little inferior, will be formed by cards VII., VIII. and IX.; cards XI., X. and XII. will occupy the Equator, and the 9 cards from XIII. to XXI. will be distributed like the 9 first, in 3 bands placed upon the lower hemisphere, as shown in Fig. 1.

But as the French book saith, the noble King Arthur would have taken his queen again, and have been accorded with Sir Launcelot, but Sir Gawaine would not suffer him by no manner of mean. And then Sir Gawaine made many men to blow upon Sir Launcelot; and all at once they called him false recreant knight.

When Mrs Nickleby had brought this interesting anecdote to a close, Pyke and Pluck, ever zealous in their patron's cause, proposed the adjournment of a detachment of the party into the next box; and with so much skill were the preliminaries adjusted, that Kate, despite all she could say or do to the contrary, had no alternative but to suffer herself to be led away by Sir Mulberry Hawk. Her mother and Mr Pluck accompanied them, but the worthy lady, pluming herself upon her discretion, took particular care not so much as to look at her daughter during the whole evening, and to seem wholly absorbed in the jokes and conversation of Mr Pluck, who, having been appointed sentry over Mrs Nickleby for that especial purpose, neglected, on his side, no possible opportunity of engrossing her attention.
When she saw him, Uraraka came to a skidding halt, her entrance loud and surprising enough to catch more than a few eyes, including Bakugou’s. The second his red eyes latched onto hers, she stomped towards him, giving him little time to narrow his eyes and say, “Ura--” before she grabbed him by the wrist and dragged him to the nearest room, which turned out to be a large supply closet.

When the board contains a straight draw or flush draw, but not a possible straight or flush, you should typically commit for a slightly higher SPR than you would otherwise. Players with draws sometimes make large semibluffs or call too much. Those who do will have weaker hands on average when they get all-in on a coordinated board, so you should be willing to put a little more into the pot. However, if your opponents bet made hands more aggressively on coordinated boards, and don’t semibluff much, you need a lower SPR to commit.
When the cutter sees criss-crossing sign on the drag, he radios another unit. That agent drives to the next drag north and cuts.

When there are two cards to come, you will also be exposedto “redraws.” If you improve to the best hand on the turn, youropponents will rarely be drawing dead. There is usually somechance that you will be outdrawn on the river. While the possiblepresence of redraws devalues any draw on the flop, some drawsare much more sensitive to redraws than others.

When the salt-cellar, and the fowl’s breast, and the trifle, and the lobster salad were all exhausted, and could not afford standing-room for another solitary witticism, the keeper performed that very dangerous feat which is still done with some of the caravan lions, although in one instance it terminated fatally, of putting his head in the animal’s mouth, and placing himself entirely at its mercy. Boswell frequently presents a melancholy instance of the lamentable results of this achievement, and other keepers and jackals have been terribly lacerated for their daring. It is due to our lion to state, that he condescended to be trifled with, in the most gentle manner, and finally went home with the showman in a hack cab: perfectly peaceable, but slightly fuddled.
When this word came to Sir Launcelot, that King Arthur and Sir Gawaine were landed upon his lands, and made a full great destruction and waste, then spake Sir Bors, and said: My lord Sir Launcelot, it is shame that we suffer them thus to ride over our lands, for wit you well, suffer ye them as long as ye will, they will do you no favour an they may handle you. Then said Sir Lionel that was wary and wise: My lord Sir Launcelot, I will give this counsel, let us keep our strong walled towns until they have hunger and cold, and blow on their nails; and then let us freshly set upon them, and shred them down as sheep in a field, that aliens may take example for ever how they land upon our lands.
When we call on the flop, we’re indicating some interest in the hand. Perhaps we have a small pair and think he might have nothing. But we might have a flush draw, and be calling to see if we can hit our flush. Or our holding might also be nothing but we’re floating (calling with nothing) to see if we can steal the pot with a later show of strength.
When you have a draw to a big hand (e.g., the nut straight orflush), the pot size determines how you should play it. If the potis small, you should usually avoid eliminating players. You getmore value from players paying you off with second-best handsthan from winning what is already in the pot. In a large potimproving your chance to win is more valuable.

Will he now bet the river with his top pair, top kicker? Most good players won’t. If he checks and you bet, will he call? He’d probably call a small bet, but fold to a larger one. In this case, hitting our flush did win us some more money, but only a little more money.

With a big pair, you hope to flop an overpair or a set and get all-in against a weaker hand. You prefer a heads-up or three-way pot, and you want a low SPR. By hitting your target SPR, you make your commitment decision easy, and you stand to make the most money when you get all-in.

Bakugo splutters in surprise and grabs the front of Kirishima’s shirt and for a second she’s absolutely sure he’s going to blast him through the wall, but then Kirishima trails his hand along the blond’s jaw and into his hair, and Bakugo’s grip on his shirt slackens just a fraction.

With that came out another knight out of the leaves, and brake a spear upon Galahad or ever he might turn him. Then Galahad drew out his sword and smote off the left arm of him, so that it fell to the earth. And then he fled, and Sir Galahad pursued fast after him. And then he turned again unto Sir Melias, and there he alighted and dressed him softly on his horse tofore him, for the truncheon of his spear was in his body; and Sir Galahad stert up behind him, and held him in his arms, and so brought him to the abbey, and there unarmed him and brought him to his chamber. And then he asked his Saviour. And when he had received Him he said unto Sir Galahad: Sir, let death come when it pleaseth him. And therewith he drew out the truncheon of the spear out of his body: and then he swooned.

With these words, after many pretty little coquettish doubts and fears, and wishes that she might not have lost it, Mary produced the letter from behind the nicest little muslin tucker possible, and handed it to Sam, who thereupon kissed it with much gallantry and devotion.
With these words the worthy woman, who appeared to have dropped in to take tea as a delicate little attention, rather than to have any engagement on the premises in an official capacity, crossed to Mr Chuffey, who was seated in the same corner as of old, and shook him by the shoulder.
With top pair you called a bet on the flop with two players still active in the hand. With an overpair or a set you might have raised, and with bottom pair or nothing you probably would have folded, but a call would be typical of anything from a pair of kings down to a pair of nines.

Yes, his own chocobo. That had been exactly what he’d been thinking about. It made sense that he was going to have to have his own. Using Loqi’s while he was in the city wouldn’t be a wise idea. It would be too used to its other rider to effectively be used by him.
Yes, it’s soundly beaten both in a straight line and round a corner by the new breed of hybrid hypercars, but, while they make a range of unusual noises, they can’t compete with the raw, visceral bellow of the T Rex that lives under the Aventador’s engine cover. Ungodly. That’s how it sounds.
Yes. This is an almost perfect position for a c-bet to take down the pot. The flop is dry and missed most of your opponent’s range. As a bonus, you know that he likes to 3-bet a lot preflop, but here he didn’t. This tells you that pairs and ace-x hands make up little of his range, so if he’s not holding a king, your ace-high is probably best.
You can also fade small bars near the top and bottom of barbwire if there is  an entry. For example, if there is a small bar near the high, especially if it is a  bear reversal bar, look to scalp a short with an entry order to sell at one tick  below the low of that bar on a stop. You can also look for 3 minute small bars to  fade as well. You should rarely, if ever, fade off 1 minute bars, because the 3  and 5 minute bars provide better winning percentages.
You can detach 1 material from this card, and if you do, negate the effects of all face-up monsters your opponent currently controls, until the end of this turn.
You can Special Summon this card (from your hand) to your opponent's field in Attack Position, by Tributing 1 monster they control.
You have top pair with a good kicker, but right now your opponent could have a set, a club flush, or even a straight. His betting is consistent with either hitting a set on the flop or making a flush on the turn. In addition, his image is that of a solid player whose post-flop betting isn’t out of line.
You have two overcards, a backdoor flush draw, and a zero-gap,backdoor straight draw. None of your draws is very strongindividually, but there are 22 turn cards that improve your handsignificantly (10 hearts and 3 non-heart kings, queens, jacks, andnines). Counting outs, you might estimate that your two overcardsare worth a total of three outs (six cards are worth about half anout each; you should not count them as full outs because top pairis often beaten), and your backdoor flush and straight draws areeach worth 1.5 outs. Your hand has a value of about six outs.
You like the idea of playing a pot in position against this player, so you call and the blinds fold. The pot is now 6,300.

You make $7.25 an hour at Taco Bell and still think you're all that and a bag of chips, huh?
Your aggressive opponent bets $20, and the next player folds. You have $94 remaining. This flop is excellent for your hand, giving you a nearly 1 in 3 chance of making a straight by the river. (By the Four Times Rule it’s 32 percent.) Plus, you could draw out on a bigger pair by catching a set, and you may even have the best hand.
you’re selling is, potentially, the answer will they begin to look at the        details. That’s where they dig into the bells and whistles, what’s included  and what’s an add-on, what it’s like to work with you.
Your hand hasn’t improved since the flop: it’s still only top pair, good kicker. You could be losing to trip eights or various sets or even some Overpairs. Nevertheless, you have a solid value bet because your opponent hasn’t done anything that suggests he has a better hand. His half-pot bet on the flop looks like a straight continuation bet and may not mean anything. His check on the turn suggests that he either doesn’t have anything or has something, but is playing pot control.
Your hand, top pair with a modest kicker, is even weaker than in our last couple of examples. Still, a bet is worth considering. The board has both potential flush and straight draws, and of course sets and two pair hands are also possible. But your opponent checked the river, so it’s unlikely he actually has any of these holdings. The stronger the hand, the more likely he wants to bet the river when first to act because there’s too much danger that you’ll check behind if he checks. The fact that he didn’t bet the river forces you to downgrade his range dramatically. Consequently, his most likely holding is a pair from queens down through eights.
Your last bet actually fits a bunch of hands you could have been holding. If you started with two clubs, you hit a flush. If you started with a pair of fives, you made a straight. You might also have a set, or a pair of queens. Of course, he could have any of these hands too, but his betting indicates that he doesn’t.
Your opponent will be forced to call with many hands that you beat. Indeed, he may call with any pair (except pocket pairs below sixes). Why does he have to call? Say he restricts himself to calling with top pair or better. He’s playing a wide range of hands to begin with, and he’ll flop a pair with his non-paired hands only one time in three. Overall, he’s a major dog to flop a hand as good as top pair.
Your raise was a semi-bluffsince your hand was not the best buthad a good chance of improving. The raise did several things. It boughta free card since the player with the best hand after the flop (tripQueens), fearing your raise, never bet them again. By inducing youropponents to check, you saw the river card for free. Since bets doubleafter the turn, your raise was only half the amount required to call abet after the turn card (a significant savings). Your raise also pro-vided information. Your opponent could have flopped a full houseand you could be drawing dead--that is, even if you hit the flush,you still lose. Not re-raising, and checking to you later on, is a signalthat your opponent does not have a full house or four of a kind.
Your session is about to time out.
• You should plan around the hand you are most likely to make if you hit the flop. With kings, you are most likely to have an overpair postflop, so you should plan around flopping that hand.44
