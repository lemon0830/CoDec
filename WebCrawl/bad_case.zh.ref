Both eyes must gaze forward from the tiger's mouth of the front hand, the middle joint of the index finger at eye level. Employing the "eye shield" technique allows one to gauge and assess the enemy's movements, waiting for the opportune moment to act and take advantage.

Wulong Palace, officially known as Xingsheng Wulong Palace, is situated north of Tianzhu Peak, facing east, backed by Lingying Peak, and facing Jinsuo Peak. It is encircled by Muzhen Well, Qingyang Creek, and Feiyun Creeks. The terrain hides the wind and gathers qi, positioned as if a tiger crouching and a dragon coiling.

Looking south to Tianzhu Peak, 6,000 meters away, where the mountain's grandeur stands tall and the golden palace shines with solemn brilliance. Thus, immortals have praised Wulong as a paradise where "thousands of lotus flowers embrace the palace".

Moreover, the difference between the 生生生 and 生水生 builds compared to the control group is merely around one attribute. Thus, for Venti equipped with specialized weapons, when selecting the four main artifact attributes, it's best to choose whichever attribute is more favorable rather than insisting on the perfect artifact set.

Yi Bingzhou, styled Zusi and known as Moqing, with aliases such as Nanquan, Qiushui, and Xihu Chang, and later called Mo'an or Yitingzhou, hailed from Ninghua, Tingzhou, Fujian. A Qing dynasty scholar and calligrapher, his father Yi Chaodong, was a successful candidate in the imperial examinations in the 34th year of Qianlong's reign and served in various governmental roles. Yi Bingzhou was rigorously trained from a young age, studying under Yin Chengfang with a focus on cultivating moral integrity. Recognized by Grand Secretary Zhu Gui and esteemed by Ji Xiaolan, he became Ji's disciple and also studied calligraphy under Liu Yong. Passing the imperial examination in the 54th year of Qianlong's reign (1789), he served in the Ministry of Justice and was later promoted. In the fourth year of Jiaqing's reign (1799), he became the magistrate of Huizhou. Following a dispute with his superior, the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi Ji Qing, he was exiled to military service but was later reinstated as the magistrate of Yangzhou. He also served as the superintendent of rivers and granaries and salt transportation commissioner. He resigned following his father's death and withdrew from public life.

Yuan Haowen, also known as Yishan, famed for the eternal question, "What is love in this world, that it demands our commitment unto death?" once dwelled in Luoyang before serving as county magistrate in Zhenping, Neixiang, and Nanyang. Frequently traversing through Lushi, it's possible that beneath the thatched eaves beside the Tanghe Inn, while gazing upon the vast expanse of stars and moons and listening to the powerful currents of the Guanhe River, his thoughts turned to his daughter Yuan Yan, married into the Lu family. These reflections might have inspired him to pen: "Through the paths between the stork cliffs and fish caverns, months pass without return. During the Cold Food Festival, returning home I see the girl next door, as my entire family turns to gaze upon the western mountains." (Yuan Haowen, revered as Mr. Yishan, hailed from Xinzhou, Shanxi.)
In the early stages of HT, Professor Feng Jianhua applied emetic therapy to treat symptoms such as epigastric fullness, reduced appetite, palpitations, restlessness, irritability, and frequent dreaming. He identified these symptoms as indicative of Qi stagnation, excessive Heat, and accumulation of phlegm-dampness, consistent with the Treatise on Cold Damage which states, "When there is fullness under the heart causing distress, and a desire to eat but an inability to do so, the ailment lies within the chest and should be expelled through vomiting." Emetic therapy was utilized to smooth the flow of Qi, awaken the mind by expelling, and thus achieve the intended therapeutic effect, with the Three-Ingredient Powder being the chosen formula. After a reduction in symptoms, the Four Gentlemen Decoction was prescribed to nurture the stomach Qi. However, due to patients' general reluctance towards emetic therapy, its application in clinical practice by Professor Feng Jianhua was relatively limited.

Thus encapsulates the profound doctrine of acupuncture.

The master replied, "Not the same." Yuan asked, "Why is it not  the same?" The master replied, "When he eats, he doesn't want to  eat, and has countless demands; when he sleeps, he doesn't want to sleep, and  has a thousand concerns. That's why it's not the same." The lawyer was  speechless.

Born in Kuaiji, Zhejiang, he, courtesy name Xiangyu and literary name Feifei, hailed from a lineage established in the Wu region by his grandfather, and the family subsequently settled there.

Moving to Yuanpu at nine, he endured the loss of both his birth and stepmother, yet managed his familial duties with maturity.

A sage is not limited to a single mentor. Confucius was a disciple of Tanyu, Chang Hong, Shixiang, and Lao Dan, yet among Tanyu's followers, none was as wise as Confucius. He once declared, "In the company of three, one is surely my teacher." Hence, it is not necessary for a disciple to be lesser than the teacher, nor for a teacher to always be wiser than the disciple. The comprehension of the Dao happens in its own time, and individuals may excel in different domains. Such is the essence of learning.
Located at the back of the central sulcus, above the posterior branch of the lateral sulcus, and in front of a line from the top of the parieto-occipital sulcus to the preoccipital notch. The lateral dorsal surface features the postcentral sulcus, running parallel to the central sulcus, with the postcentral gyrus nestled between them. The intraparietal sulcus begins at the upper part of the postcentral sulcus, running parallel to the dorsal surface's inner edge, moving backward below the top end of the parieto-occipital sulcus, then turning downward to form the transverse occipital sulcus. This sulcus divides the back of the parietal lobe into the superior and inferior parietal lobules. The area of the inferior parietal lobule that wraps around the end of the lateral sulcus's posterior branch is called the supramarginal gyrus, while its rear section that encompasses the end of the superior temporal sulcus is the angular gyrus.
In the "Preface to the Complete Works of Master Hongyi," Master Xuyun expressed his deep reverence for Master Hongyi: "Before his ordination, Master Hongyi was celebrated as a dashing and gifted young man. Upon embracing the full precepts, he renounced all worldly ties, adopting a lifestyle of barefoot simplicity and enlightened discipline. He exemplified the teachings through his deeds, followed in his mentors' steps, reinvigorated the Dharma during times of decline, and upheld the highest of virtues without fault. His integrity was manifest, and his wisdom echoed widely, spreading his influence far beyond. Those familiar with Master Hongyi recognized his profound understanding of the Vinaya; those who revered him understood the depth of their respect for the Dharma. Taking on the Tathagata's legacy, he was the epitome of a true teacher." A decade after Master Hongyi's departure (This preface was penned in 1948), his name continues to inspire awe and admiration among all who hear it, a testament to his enduring legacy. As Master Xuyun noted, "His esteemed place in the world today is no accident.

Cold Dew, marking the time when dew turns cold and autumn deepens. The earth, adorned with fallen leaves, gains a soft coat, upon which the sunlight silently rests, listening to the tales of each leaf from the past. Time cleans up the debris and fragments memories. The path once taken has now blurred, and the destination matters no more. To fall is the leaf's destiny. No matter the efforts of spring to bud or summer to flourish, autumn inevitably brings departure. Leaves destined to fall, fruits destined to drop, seeds destined to fly away, and husks destined to decay. Deep in autumn, departures are found everywhere, yet the withering branches and leaves return their essence to the earth.

Introduced by someone, I apprenticed at Liuji Steamed Food Shop behind Hou's residence. After my three-year apprenticeship, my esteemed friend set up a small bun stall on Middle Street behind Hou's without initially having a signboard. Relying on our skills, we made and sold buns with generous fillings and thin skins. As our business flourished, my friend acquired a shop and named it "Dejuhao". During peak hours, I, nicknamed "Gouzi," was too busy selling buns to chat with customers, leading them to jest, "Gouzi sells buns, totally unresponsive." Eventually, I was dubbed "Goubuli," and the name "Dejuhao" fell into obscurity.

I understand that you're suggesting using "㨃" to replace the incorrect word "怼" and asking for my assistance in leading the correction of this mistake. However, "㨃" is not a recognized character in the standard Chinese writing system, and it would not be appropriate to use it as a replacement. It's important to adhere to proper spelling and grammar rules in written communication. I'm here to help with any language-related questions or concerns you may have.

Master Hongyi passed into nirvana in 1942 at the age of 63. Before his departure, he bequeathed two gathas: "The bond between gentlemen, akin to the mildness of water. Holding onto appearances while seeking, distances shrink to mere inches." "You inquire about my destination, yet I leave words behind. With branches brimming with spring, and the cosmic heart moon complete." Master Xuyun entered nirvana in 1959, aged 120. Early enlightenment came to him as a teacup's fall and breakage abruptly ended his doubts, inspiring the verse: "A cup descends, its sound crisp and resonant. Even voidness shatters, pacifying the wild heart instantly." Another verse he penned goes: "Scalded hands, a cup lies broken, with devastation unspeakable. Spring's arrival adorns everywhere in fragrance; the vastness of mountains and rivers embodies the Thus-Come-One." One a distinguished Vinaya monk, the other, a venerable Chan sage. Yet, the merit of these eminent monks transcends the confines of their earthly years.
The principle of survival of the fittest is an inherent law of nature, advocating for killing out of necessity rather than cruelty. Were humanity not dominant, we too would find ourselves vulnerable at the food chain's lower echelons. The gentleman's aversion to the kitchen stems from his distaste for witnessing the act of killing, yet his consumption remains unaffected. Gratitude towards nature for sustaining us is paramount, as is our duty to honor and not unduly ravage it.
Many often misjudge such risks, even those at the pinnacle, who might deem their position secure and trouble-free. Throughout my journey, I've walked uprightly, without fear of unfounded accusations. Yet, the concept of being accused without basis, where allegations arise whether they are true or not, presents a substantial risk. Many admire those at the summit for their apparent success and brilliance, unaware of the struggles they face. Living "on the edge of an abyss, treading on thin ice" aptly describes the constant state of vigilance required by those at the top.

On the eve of the Wushen day, just before dawn, Ziying and I awaited the sunrise at the Sun-viewing Pavilion amidst the fifth watch's toll. A gale swept up the snow, pelting our faces. Clouds blanketed the view east of the pavilion, within which emerged the silhouette of numerous peaks, stark white like the Cudrania wood, amidst the mist. A singular streak across the zenith tinted differently soon blossomed into a spectrum of five colors. Upon sunrise, the sun blazed a vivid cinnabar red, underlined by fluctuating scarlet rays—some speculated it to be the East Sea. Glancing back at the western peaks from the pavilion, the sun's visibility varied, casting a mottled tapestry of purple and white, all seemingly contorted.
Driven by a longing for Wu and Yue, I traversed the moonlit Mirror Lake in my dreams, the lunar reflection escorting me to Shanxi Creek. Master Xie's retreat, still standing, resonates with the crystal-clear cries of monkeys across the rippled waters. Donning Master Xie's sandals, I embarked up the celestial ladder. Mid-ascent, the sun's glow bathed the sea, while celestial roosters echoed in the void. A labyrinth of cliffs obscured the path, with dusk falling abruptly amidst bewitched flora and crags. Deep within the rocky springs, bears bellowed and dragons hymned, startling the dense forest's peak. Clouds, verdant with the promise of rain, and tranquil waters birthed mist. Lightning fissured and mountains crumbled, revealing the celestial portal abruptly. An unfathomable abyss, illuminated by sun and moon, unveiled a pavilion of gold and silver. Adorned in a rainbow, carried by the breeze, attended by a host of cloud-born sovereigns. Tiger beats and phoenix-drawn chariots circled, as immortals thronged densely. A sudden shudder of my soul, a stir of my essence, jolted me awake with a sigh. All that remains is the realization that the enchantment of yore has faded beside my current rest.
Though I lack the artistry to bring blooms to life in my dreams, capturing the quintessence of the 'Half-Yang Stone Sail' is beyond me. Yet, encountering Lin Shuzhen's, a Qing Dynasty poetess, poetic tribute to it shed new light: "Tales of an emperor's ship from days gone by, its twin sails captured in these lines; perhaps, due to the perilous waves of troubled times, it remains moored to this day, its anchor yet to be drawn." Her words bring a nuanced understanding to the sublime beauty of "Half-Yang Stone Sail" .
As a son of the grand Chinese nation, each stroke and character forms its backbone; across the vast Nine Provinces, every word and ink gleams like the sun. My vision encompasses China, where the shining of the five stars signifies our faith.

My paternal ancestors settled in Ninghe Xiguan during the Ming Dynasty, with our progenitor named Li Rong. At that juncture, Ninghe had not yet been established as a county. Families were traditionally referred to by their 'hall' names, and ours was known as 'Wu Ben Tang'. A local adage humorously describes Ninghe's notable families as 'Sour Tan, Stinky Du, Fishy Yu, Cawing Lin, alongside Shameless Chang and Honest Li'—of which, we are the 'Honest Li'.
As a result, the morale within our forces remains somewhat diminished, with various odd rumors beginning to spread among the troops. For instance, "Counterattack to Shandong". Another rumor goes, "General Chen's telegrams resound with taps, while the soldiers' footsteps echo with plops". There's even talk of "Movement without combat, merely parading dragon lanterns".

In film or major productions by leading companies, disputes over rankings and screen time are minimal, with directors and investors making most decisions. However, filming dramas, especially historical ones, often leads to conflicts: top-tier actors avoid overshadowing, those of equal status resist collaboration, and those in the middle quarrel over rankings, roles, and compensation. Consequently, prioritizing the drama's quality is becoming less common, while the inclination to monopolize benefits increases.

When discussing Fujian, Xiamen is often seen as dominating the scene.
Collecting and playing with cultural relics fundamentally involve "playing". Although Bodhi seeds carry profound Buddhist cultural significance, this connection has been gradually diluted through relentless commercialization. The simplicity behind this shift is that enthusiasts prefer the freedom of play over strict guidelines. Intended as a stress-reliever, overly rigid rules make playing tense. Consequently, as Bodhi seeds have become more mainstream, the link between their Buddhist roots and contemporary use has weakened, turning them into a form of popular entertainment. However, olive pits also hold their ground as worthy play objects.
The term "literary youth" often resonates with Yihe Road, a place adorned with never-tiring paths of phoenix trees and nestled Republic-era mansions behind towering walls, all radiating a profound cultural vibe.

After Japan's strategic substitution, they rallied strongly. Haruyo Shimamura capitalized on a scoring opportunity, and Mihoko Naguchi's counterattack closed the gap to 15-16. China then brought in main attacker Wu Mengjie, who managed to block effectively. Japan kept up until 17-18, but couldn't withstand China's momentum as Wang Yuanyuan scored, bringing the score to 20-17 in China's favor. Japan fought back to 20-23, but Yuan Xinyue's swift attack scored, giving China a 24-20 lead and match point. Osaka Yang scored a point for Japan, but Wu Mengjie's powerful attack clinched the victory for China at 25-21, winning the match 3-0 against Japan and securing the championship.

Yang Shen, a distinguished talent of the Ming Dynasty, contended: "The deterioration of calligraphy commenced with Yan Zhenqing. From him onwards, the essence of the Jin dynasty's style was lost until the late Tang... Until Zhao Zi'ang arrived, who corrected the flaws of Yan and Liu, taking the Jin as his model. After him, there was but one." Thus, to those who adhere to Fengxi's brushwork as the "orthodox lineage," Yan Zhenqing seemingly lacked merit. This isn't a matter of overestimation, but rather a difference in evaluative standards.

On a summer vacation research trip to Russia, I discovered that except for the opulent 20,000 RMB tours, standard packages invariably feature shopping stops at Zijin and Hu Po, with transparent pricing for optional purchases. Our package, slightly above 10,000 RMB, boasted inclusive visits to iconic sites like the Kremlin and Yekaterinburg Palace, alongside special meals, circus and ballet performances, a boat tour, and the Armed Forces Museum, all requiring extra payment. A notable perk of international versus domestic group travel is the absence of obligatory activities, making direct cost comparisons between ticket prices and outside dining somewhat irrelevant. The trip, especially during the autumn's splendid views, felt akin to a semi-independent journey given its cost.
In the end, Pang Qingyun's urgent challenge was effectively a directive for San Ge to preemptively end his life rather than face the ultimate grim reality of execution.

Ganzhou's culinary landscape boasts the unique Hakka rice noodles, with Da Yu's 'scalded skin' standing out.

Every individual inherently holds the wisdom within this scripture; none are devoid of it. Yet, ensnared by illusions and detached from true awareness, many fail to engage in reflective introspection and enlightenment. Thus, upon the manifestation of the Avatamsaka's Tathagata and his attainment of supreme enlightenment, he marveled, proclaiming the innate potential within all beings to embody the Tathagata's wisdom and virtues. Their only barrier: the shackles of their own delusions. Once freed from these, the path to enlightenment opens.

Introduced in the Qing Dynasty by Liang Zhangju, a distinguished official, Wuyi Rock Tea's esteemed qualities of "lively, sweet, clear, and fragrant" were vividly captured in his memoirs. During his retreat at Tianyou Temple in Wuyi, nightly tea discussions revealed a nuanced classification: fragrance as the foundation, surpassed only by clarity, which without sweetness denotes mere mediocrity. Elevated sweetness without liveliness remains commendable yet incomplete. True excellence is achieved when liveliness infuses sweetness, marking the pinnacle of tea mastery.

Pei Gong's forces were encamped at Ba Shang, without yet encountering Xiang Yu. Pei Gong's Left Marshal, Cao Wushang, dispatched a message to Xiang Yu stating, "Pei Gong aspires to reign over Guanzhong with Ziying as his chancellor, boasting a wealth of treasures." Enraged, Xiang Yu declared, "By tomorrow's feast for my troops, we shall commence the onslaught against Pei Gong's army!" At this juncture, Xiang Yu's formidable host of 400,000 was positioned at Hongmen in Xinfeng, contrasting with Pei Gong's 100,000 at Ba Shang. Fan Zeng counseled Xiang Yu, "Pei Gong, during his tenure in Shandong, exhibited a lust for riches and beauties. Now within Guanzhong's gates, he shows no interest in wealth nor consort, indicating profound ambitions. Observations of his army's spirit reveal draconian and tiger-like vigor, imbued with a quintet of hues – the mark of sovereign destiny. A swift strike is imperative, lest we forfeit this chance!"
In the midst of unending conflict between Henan and Hebei, Zhao Zan proposed a financial scheme targeting the amassed wealth among affluent merchants. He suggested that merchants capable of donating ten thousand guan could retain an equivalent amount for business operations, with any excess being loaned to the government for military support, aiming to gather five million guan. The emperor endorsed this plan, with a promise to reimburse the funds once hostilities ceased. Seizing the moment, Chang'an's magistrate, Xue Cui, embarked on a campaign under the guise of asset collection, employing coercive measures against those he deemed insincere. This led to widespread grievance and despair, driving some to suicide. The capital descended into chaos, mirroring a city under siege by bandits.

Wenfa is a therapeutic approach in Traditional Chinese Medicine that employs warmth to eliminate internal coldness, addressing what is known as interior cold syndrome. This syndrome is categorized based on its root causes into two main types: cold resulting from a deficiency in yang energy, and cold stemming directly from an external cold pathogen. Depending on the specific manifestations and intensity of the cold syndrome—such as its exact bodily location and the degree of severity—the application of Wenfa can be tailored to include warming the body's core, heating the pathways of the meridians, dispersing internal cold, or reviving the body's yang energy. A deficiency in yang energy can lead to impaired metabolic processes and contribute to the accumulation of phlegm and blood stasis. The principle that "yang energy drives metabolic processes, while yin energy gives form to the body," as discussed in "The Great Treatise on the Correspondences of Yin and Yang" from the classic text "Su Wen," underpins this treatment strategy. Consequently, to counteract a yin (cold) pathogen, the strategy involves applying warmth to stimulate and reinforce the body's yang energy. Once yang energy is replenished, the pathological cold influence is naturally expelled.

Lingxia, a mystical valley, is where Ling Water, Lingzhi mushrooms, the spiritual "灵" character, sacred objects, and spiritual jade converge in harmony.

"In a reflection akin to the philosophical meditations found in traditional texts, a sentiment is expressed: 'Despite the abundance of gold and jade, the prime years of life pass meaninglessly. Henceforth, I shall find contentment in simple pleasures, such as a full meal and peaceful sleep, forsaking the pursuit of alchemical knowledge to embrace a millennium of serene contemplation.' Li Zhi, a philosopher from the Ming Dynasty, similarly articulates in 'Phoenix Tail Grass Notes': 'Even with halls filled with gold and jade, and vast fields beyond, such possessions hold no allure for me.'"

Upon seeing this announcement, my heart tightened. Suddenly, I remembered the possibly dust-covered "Ai Ge" magazines on my bookshelf at home, night after night of respite during my high school years. Sunlight filtering through the acacia trees on the playground, unrequited love, and the idealized "moonlight" of youth didn't pertain to me. My youth was plain, with reading as seemingly my sole connection to the world. Saying goodbye isn't easy, but it seems life is full of choices, each awaiting a turn of fate. Farewell, "Ai Ge", farewell to all the unseen friends in the editorial department. Mountains unchanged, rivers everlasting - till we meet again.

Having turned collected flowers into honey, I dedicate my efforts to the nation, sweetening the populace's life." Reflecting on these verses today, Wang Min remains profoundly stirred.

In traditional times, both the royal family and the government often exploited merchants through coercive trade practices. Bai Juyi's "The Charcoal Seller" illustrates the Tang Dynasty officials' process of coercive purchasing. More than a thousand kilograms of charcoal were traded for just half a piece of red silk and a yard of satin: "A cart of charcoal, weighing over a thousand kilograms, reluctantly taken away by palace emissaries. For half a piece of red silk and a yard of satin, tied to the oxen's head as the price for the charcoal." Similarly, during the Ming Dynasty, the practice persisted in government offices, where only half the due price was paid: "They paid only half. For instance, for a fan worth two coins, only one coin was offered, and the same applied to other goods, greatly distressing the merchants." Despite the merchants' grievances, they were powerless to change their situation. This practice was commonplace across many dynasties, with a prevailing attitude: if someone has risked their life to secure their realm, isn't it reasonable for them to enjoy some perks?
Fourth, the most intriguing concept within Chinese philosophy is the interplay of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements. Beyond the well-discussed Yin and Yang, the Five Elements operate on two key principles: the cycles of generation and restraint. Metal generates water, water nurtures wood, wood fuels fire, fire creates earth, and earth forms metal — this forms the generative cycle. Conversely, metal cuts wood, wood depletes earth, earth absorbs water, water quenches fire, and fire melts metal, illustrating the restraining cycle. The second principle illustrates the Five Elements' interconnectedness with the universe, aligning with the five cardinal directions (east, south, west, north, and center), colors (green, white, red, black, and yellow), musical notes (do, re, mi, sol, la), and tastes (sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, salty), among other associations.

Diabetes is classified as "Xiao Ke" syndrome in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), a condition known as "wasting-thirst." Ancient texts, such as the "Plain Questions - Treatise on Extraordinary Diseases," discuss this ailment: "The Emperor inquired about a condition characterized by a sweet taste in the mouth, questioning its name and cause. Qi Bo responded, 'This results from an overflow of the five Qi, leading to what is termed spleen depletion. The ingestion of various flavors, once assimilated by the stomach, relies on the spleen to distribute their quintessence. Fluids within the spleen hence induce sweetness in the mouth, signaling overindulgence. Such conditions arise from frequent consumption of rich, sweet foods, leading to obesity. Excess weight generates internal heat, and sweetness causes satiety, thereby causing Qi to ascend and manifest as wasting-thirst syndrome.'"
Even if it's akin to firing a shot after the battle has ended, it still reveals the intrinsic nature of a scholar deeply concerned for his country and its people.

In the twenty-eighth year of the Tonghe era (1010 AD), the Liao Dynasty campaigned against the Uighurs, conquering Ganzhou and Suzhou and capturing their people. Throughout the Kai Tai era, repeated campaigns against Goryeo led to considerable territorial acquisitions... It can be stated that under Yelü Longxu's reign, regions and tribes to the west like the Uighurs and Gaochang, and to the east like Bohai, Jurchen, and Goryeo, were thoroughly subdued, forced to submit and pay tribute. This brought Emperor Shengzong of the Liao the prestige of dominion from all quarters, culminating in the empire's territorial peak, famously described in the "History of Liao" as spanning "ten thousand li" (a Chinese measure of distance, roughly equivalent to 3,000 miles).

Purely focusing on Hydro generation is discouraged for Jinpo.

Su Zi, somber and sitting with dignity, queried the visitor, "What is the reason for this?" The visitor responded, "'With the moon shining and stars scarce, magpies flying south,' isn't this a poem by Cao Mengde? Looking west to Xiaci and east to Wuchang, rivers and mountains intertwined, a verdant expanse. Isn't this Mengde's predicament against Zhou Lang? After conquering Jingzhou and capturing Jiangling, they sailed eastward with the current, with thousands of boats and flags covering the sky. They enjoyed wine by the river, composed poetry with a spear in hand. He was once a great hero, but where is he now? "Moreover, here we are, fishing and gathering firewood on the banks of the river, companions of fish and shrimp, friends with deer and elk. We ride a small boat, lifting our cups and gourds in camaraderie. We are like tiny mayflies in the vastness of heaven and earth, mere grains of sand in the boundless sea. I lament the brevity of our lives and envy the endlessness of the Yangtze River. Let us embrace immortality and wander freely, holding the bright moon until the end. We know that such sudden gains are impossible, so we entrust our echoes to the mournful wind."
Su Zi remarked, "Are you also acquainted with the essence of water and the moon? The past flows away like this, never truly present; the cycles of waxing and waning persist without end, neither diminishing nor expanding. Observing through the lens of change, not even the heavens and earth can grasp a fleeting instant; seen from the standpoint of the immutable, all things, myself included, are infinite. What, then, is there to envy? Furthermore, in the domain between heaven and earth, every entity has its master. If it doesn’t belong to me, not even the smallest bit should be taken. Yet, the crisp breeze over the river and the luminous moon among the mountains, become sound to the ear and color to the eye, freely taken, their use never depleting. This represents the creator's boundless bounty, which you and I are privileged to enjoy together."

To understand the character of the "Drunken Monk," it is necessary to look at the description of him in the original work. The book provides limited information about his experiences, even less than that of the character Dugu Qiubai. It only mentions: "He does not reveal his name or background, only stating that he has devoted his life to Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, without adhering to any particular path. One day, he competed in a drinking contest on Mount Song and defeated the founder of the Quanzhen Sect, Wang Chongyang. As a result, he was able to borrow and study the 'Nine Yin Manual.' Although deeply impressed by the profound martial arts techniques described in the manual, he found them too focused on promoting the 'Laozi's teachings,' emphasizing the use of softness to overcome hardness and yin to conquer yang. He believed that this approach fell short of the true harmony of yin and yang. Therefore, within the lines of the four-volume Sanskrit text, 'Leng Qie Jing,' he wrote his own creation, the 'Nine Yang Manual,' in Chinese. He believed that his manual, which emphasized the harmony of yin and yang and the blending of hardness and softness, surpassed the one-sidedly yin-oriented 'Nine Yin Manual.'"

Indeed, as the saying goes, "Reeds on the wall are top-heavy, with shallow roots; bamboo shoots in the mountains have sharp mouths, thick skin, and hollow insides." Chen Chunhua's actions and words are clearly observed by Huawei.

They despise opportunism, deception, and compromising for petty gains. As the saying goes, "Different paths cannot lead to the same destination." In this light, Huawei's firm statement that "Chen Chunhua cannot possibly understand Huawei" is not impulsive but a carefully considered judgment.

This song has a distinct "Renke" vibe, epitomizing innocence and simplicity. There’s a moment when Renke, merely holding a microphone, reminds me of his performance in "Spring Sounds So Beautiful." Back then, as a carefree 20-year-old, he cheerfully greeted the arrival of spring, and today, he is still searching for answers, adrift in the wind. The arrangement by Wutiao Ren retains the framework from their previous concert at the Guangzhou Sports Arena, with music that is rich and full. The last line, "But you can't feel my heart crying, just casually asking if you’re okay today," evokes a "young Leonard Cohen" or Bob Dylan during his "Rolling Thunder Revue" period.

The Diamond Sutra calls upon Bodhisattvas to cultivate the mind of enlightenment, aiming to lead all sentient beings to exhaustive liberation, achieving Nirvana without the perception of any sentient being being liberated. It advocates for the practice of generosity without attachment to physical form, sound, smell, taste, touch, or any phenomena. Generosity is highlighted as the principal among the six paramitas (perfections) and all-encompassing practices. Engaging in giving, while maintaining precepts, practicing patience, diligence, meditation, and wisdom, should be done without attachment to sensory experiences. This summary of the sutra emphasizes generosity as a representation of the broader practices. The sutra encourages cultivating a mind free from attachments, devoid of the concepts of self, others, sentient beings, and lifespan, to practice all virtuous deeds.

Following the revelation of Angelababy Yang Ying attending the Crazy Horse Show, there has even been real-name reporting by some netizens against her. Consequently, "Running Man" removed the Weibo posts of its original crew. Clearly, in the midst of this public opinion storm, they prefer not to be dragged into the controversy.

"Shuang Pie Sun" from Tianmen showcases a musical journey starting with a delicate B-flat major melody, encapsulating the lightheartedness of sisters' adventures.

The variation continues in the third line, finally settling in E major and concluding in G major.

Ding noted that in the early Song Dynasty, the Li people of Hainan engaged primarily in diligent farming and did not focus exclusively on agarwood collection. They collected agarwood occasionally, with specific times and buyers for sales, indicating agarwood collection was a secondary occupation with fixed sale parameters. By the mid-Song Dynasty, trading with the Li for agarwood in exchange for cattle became prevalent, signifying agarwood collection's evolution into a regular economic activity among the Li people. One could exchange a cow for a load of agarwood, carefully selecting to find one waterlogged piece in every ten or twelve loads, marking a significant shift towards agarwood collection as a normalized economic endeavor.
Following the "Nanjing Case" in the late Wanli period, Catholicism saw a resurgence by the Chongzhen era, particularly flourishing in regions like Fujian. As Ming Confucian scholar Wang Chaoshi noted, "Initially, according to the Nangong Office records, there were merely thirteen foreigners entering China; now, they are too numerous to count." This significant increase in the Catholic presence led to renewed criticism from Confucian scholars, highlighting the tension between emerging Catholic influence and traditional Confucian values.

In Hangzhou, culinary practices have evolved beyond mere sustenance to become an art form deeply interwoven with aesthetic pleasure. Delicacies such as water chestnuts, fox nuts, perch, lotus seeds, plums, and lotus roots are immortalized in the verse of the literati. Among them, Southern Song poet Yang Wanli harbored a particular fondness for lotus seeds, a sentiment captured in his poetry: 'Lotus seed vendors traverse the city, journeying toward West Lake through wilderness. Plucking seeds from lotus blooms, they capture flavors kissed by the moon's glow.' The transformation of crab from a staple of the impoverished to a celebrated element of cultural festivities — akin to moon gazing, chrysanthemum viewing, and wine savoring — stands as a testament to the literati's ability to elevate the mundane to the sublime, a tradition that endures to this day.

Liangniang languishes from unrequited love, her health fading day by day. On the eve of Mid-Autumn Festival, she captures her once-flourishing beauty in a painting and composes a poem: "Up close, one sees the solemn dignity; from afar, as carefree as a soaring fairy. Should I accompany guests in the Moon Palace in years to come, I'd rather be by the willows than the plums." She implores her mother to bury her beneath the garden's plum tree and instructs her maid, Chunxiang, to conceal her self-portrait beneath a Taihu stone. Thus, her youthful passions are interred at the Plum Blossom Nunnery, her yearning severed at the Peony Pavilion, leaving but a wisp of her soul amid the broken well and dilapidated walls.

The maze of streets and alleys of Erzun Sanjie, culminating in the 99th Lane, intricately weaves to form the renowned layout of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams. The village is notable for its crossroads adorned with several watchtowers, of which three still stand today. These towers, beyond their roles in marking time, lighting, and navigation, also function in theft and fire prevention. In the event of a theft, alarms from the watchtowers trigger the closing of gates and release of dogs to apprehend the intruder. Conversely, should a fire ignite, villagers rally with buckets and basins to combat the blaze.

The five colors blind the sight, the five tones deafen the hearing, and the five flavors numb the taste.

I came up with a plan to honor my uncle and nurture the orphan, hence convened our disciples to discuss the situation and contemplate future steps. It was suggested that, "It might be wiser for us to disperse, heading either north or south as it suits us, to address immediate needs. Once the younger brother matures, we can consider a strategy for long-term stability. Our revered master is getting on in years; the climate of the north, being unfamiliar, it's better he returns south where he can sustain himself with our assistance. Moreover, with other family members present, the young child will be well cared for. It would be optimal for the master's wife to remain in the capital to look after the orphan. We, as his disciples, ought to contribute rice and share our earnings to support them, as a way to honor our teacher's memory..." Upon hearing this, I concurred. At that time, Pan Zhixuan, Ruan Yuntai, both Prime Ministers, and Yao Bo'ang, all former teachers of the late Master, also supported this proposal, which confirmed my decision.

My second son, Yi, married into the Wu family from Meiliang, in Kuaiji, and was presented with "The Wu Family's Genealogical Chronicles" and "The Ancestral Worship Covenant" composed by his mother-in-law, Lady Yuan. He sought my review of these documents. Upon examining them, I was moved to sigh, "How can the scope of one's ambitions and capacities not be vastly different? The task of compiling family genealogies and establishing ancestral lands typically falls to scholars and officials. Such endeavors are beyond the reach of ordinary people, let alone women secluded in their quarters. Meiliang once aspired to complete the ancestral genealogy and designate lands for sacrificial purposes but passed away before he could do so. Lady Yuan, mourning the loss of her father-in-law and husband and faced with the care of an orphaned child, traveled thousands of miles for their burial. She dedicated the inherited lands as ancestral property rather than keeping them for personal gain. From the venerable Duke Minhui down, each generation has endeavored to live honorably and perpetuate their legacy. These tasks, often deferred by scholars and officials, were resolutely undertaken and accomplished by Lady Yuan alone. Were she a man, holding a position at court, how then could the significance of her achievements be measured?"

Paul is evolving, and so is Curry, moving away from low post plays to more frequent crossovers and drives, avoiding pointless screens. Rooney, on the other hand, sticks to his tried-and-true tactics. Yet, one player remains unchanged: Klay Thompson. He opens the game in his signature style, shooting the moment he catches the ball, defying all logic. The real headache? Mid-game, Thompson begins to dribble, adding to the frustration. His approach isn’t limited to shooting; he's adamant about handling the ball and breaking through defenses, utterly disregarding the defenders as he makes his shots.

In the Northern Song Dynasty, Prime Minister Liu Wenmao's daughter, Liu Yue'e, hosted a match-making event at a decorated tower. She fell for the impoverished but talented scholar, Lv Mengzheng, and signaled her interest by tossing him an embroidered ball. Unbeknownst to her, her father, Liu Wenmao, disapproved of Lv's lack of wealth and sought to annul the betrothal.

Everything under heaven arises from existence; existence arises from non-existence. (Chapter 40) The nature of Dao as a thing is both elusive and vague. (Chapter 21) Invisible to the eye, it is called formless; silent to the ear, it is called soundless; intangible to touch, it is called subtle. These three qualities defy clear comprehension, blending into one form. It is neither bright above nor dark below; continuously nameless, it returns to the realm of all that is without substance. This is described as the form without form, the image without substance, the elusive and vague. Approaching it, its beginning is not seen; following it, its end is not seen. (Chapter 14) In pursuing knowledge, one accumulates daily. In pursuing the Dao, one subtracts daily. Continue subtracting until reaching non-action. With non-action, there is nothing left undone. (Chapter 48)
When beauty is universally acknowledged as such, ugliness arises. When goodness is universally acknowledged as such, evil emerges. Thus, being and non-being generate each other, difficult and easy complement each other, length and shortness define each other, height and depth rely on each other, voice and silence harmonize each other, and succession follows. Hence, the sage engages in actionless activity and imparts teaching without words. He lets everything occur without refusal, creates without claiming, accomplishes without asserting, and achieves without dwelling.
Heaven, earth, the human journey, and the passage of time all rejuvenate amidst a heavy snowfall. All bygones are lightened and eased by the snow, unfolding a fresh canvas of existence to begin anew. Here, one pens poetry with enduring affection, love, hope, and persistence.
Heaven and Earth show no partiality; they regard all beings as straw dogs. Likewise, the sage is impartial; he regards the populace as straw dogs. Between Heaven and Earth, the analogy is that of a bellows: empty, yet unyielding, active, yet ever more productive. An abundance of words leads to depletion; holding to the central essence is preferable.
Heaven and Earth are impartial, treating all creatures as straw dogs; sages are impartial, treating people as straw dogs. Is the space between Heaven and Earth not like a bellows? It is empty, yet it never collapses; the more it moves, the more it produces. Excessive words lead to exhaustion; better to maintain the balance.
The middle-aged couple, constantly looking down and seldom up, still hold hands when walking together.
Geniuses too must understand instructions; swift horses are common, but not so their discerners. Hence, even renowned horses, under the care of the unworthy, perish dishonored, not living up to their thousand-mile repute.
People are like tides at the ends of the  earth, and dust is like soil on the top of Mount Tai.

Both prioritize their popularity and aren't willing to compromise their standing for a career shift. They're keen on safeguarding their clout in the industry. The male lead for Dilraba's "Queen Dugu" remains undecided. Despite being a segmented drama, it's a major female-centric show, deterring A-list male actors from accepting supporting roles. However, Dilraba welcomes the idea of working with fresh faces, given her commanding say over her positioning and remuneration. Similarly, the male protagonists for Yang Zi's "National Beauty" aren't from the A-list category but are capable newcomers vying for attention. Benefiting from considerable promotional support, these talents are well-positioned for breakthroughs. Yang Zi's success in "Love O2O" has led her family to discuss investing in this new project. A revamp by her styling team also landed her a spot in one of the top magazines.
Good things come in pairs: Lin Shuang's  timely stop-loss, Jiang Xi's return from the wrong path, not as decisive and  cool as Jia Yi.
Sure, ab and Dami Mi are not good people.  Now they are fighting with each other, it's going to be interesting to watch.
Many debate with me, yet that product definitely works. What does it matter by which theory it's guided? Since the Republican era, there's been talk of discarding traditional medical practice while retaining the herbs, suggesting that while traditional Chinese medicine may be seen as ineffective, Chinese herbal medicine is beneficial. So, if I give you the same ingredients a chef uses, why is there a difference in the outcome? In chess, are pieces alone significant without a player's strategy? Perhaps we should measure success by who has more pieces? Some can only appreciate what's tangible, missing the essence behind its use. This mindset led some to side with Japanese aggressors during during the War of Resistance against Japan, subscribing to the belief that might equals right—they possessed tanks and grenade launchers, and

The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law  each hold their own views, arguing fiercely. In the daughter-in-law's  opinion, her husband is driven to despair by the criticism from his parents,  but in the mother-in-law's opinion, it is the daughter-in-law who suppresses  her son and causes him to be unable to think clearly.

The genealogy of the Sun clan includes  two texts, "Announcement of Ancestral Tablets on the First and Fifteenth  Days of Each Month at the Genealogy Office" and "Announcement of  Ancestral Tablets on the First and Fifteenth Days of Each Month at the  Genealogy Office during the Ten-Year Revision of the Genealogy." Both  texts explain the reason for announcing the ancestors at the genealogy office  on the first and fifteenth days of each month. The first text is recorded as  follows:
Briefly attempted piano lessons before discontinuing. Despite opportunities to reclaim her profound spiritual abilities, witnessing her brother's near-fatal encounter and facing her own grim fate in Merlin did not prompt her to awaken. Regrettably, she chose not to restore her spiritual power for self-protection.
The recently opened shop near the school gate offers ample servings. For two diners, one dish of beef stew with potatoes is ample. Our experience of ordering four dishes was excessive. This eatery boasts an elegant, slightly luxurious Chinese-style ambiance, clean and appealing. It offers private rooms upstairs, ideal for group dining. While the dish quality is average, the tea tree mushrooms stood out for us, and we particularly enjoyed the beef stew with potatoes, served with a generous amount of beef and uniquely flavorful potatoes. However, the sweet and sour pork was a tad greasy and didn't compare to Jilin's version, indicating room for improvement.
It represents the serenity found in "gathering chrysanthemums beneath the eastern hedge," the carefree spirit of "revisiting for the chrysanthemums," the exclusive affection of "once this bloom passes, none shall follow," the dedication of "preferring to embrace fragrance at the branch's end," and the grandeur of "the city clad entirely in golden armor." Esteemed as the "recluse among flowers," it stands with the plum, orchid, and bamboo as one of the "Four Gentlemen among Flowers".
During the Song Dynasty, following the Tang system, both the imperial examination and hereditary appointments were utilized. Nevertheless, the Zhao-Song dynasty established the enfeoffment system to garner the support of the scholarly gentry class. This was implemented in the eighth year of Emperor Zhenzong's Xiangfu era.

The fundamental musical scales of ancient Chinese music, Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zhi, and Yu, originated in the Spring and Autumn Period. The term "Chimiwangliang" also has ancient origins and first appeared in the "Zuo Zhuan" during the Spring and Autumn Period.
Who gets it? This culinary gem, if offered in Hangzhou, would undoubtedly top the sales charts as the city's most coveted delicacy. It's that delicious—a true oasis in Hangzhou's culinary desert. Alas, it's a Shanghai exclusive, and I feel compelled to broadcast its excellence worldwide. Missing out? You'd regret it deeply. I wonder if it's Hangzhou's local charm that diminishes its allure. But in Shanghai? This spot's fatty intestines are unparalleled in flavor. Believe me, they're so delectable, they'll leave you reeling. Don't hesitate, dive in!
Consort Chen scoffed disdainfully, speaking in a mocking tone: "The Empress truly excels at playing her cards right. What then, should we propose? Allow her free rein, hoping she fails to cause us harm this time, only to redouble her efforts in the future?"

The Cold Dew season ushers in a picturesque deep autumn in the north, with a landscape adorned by white clouds and red leaves, offering a breathtaking view from high vantage points as the layered forests don a myriad of colors. Conversely, the south experiences a strengthening autumnal embrace, characterized by cool, refreshing breezes, decreased rainfall leading to drier conditions, and the quieting of cicadas alongside the withering of lotus leaves.
During the Cold Dew season, read poetry,  appreciate paintings, and listen to music.
In the use of vibrant colors, there exists a principle known as "one uniqueness, two ingenuity, and three orderliness." "Uniqueness" pertains to the one-of-a-kind creativity and ingeniously conceived ideas that evoke astonishment; "Ingenuity" involves the artful manipulation of unexpected "variegated colors" encountered during the sculpting process.

Regarding the Feitian Luma, the heavenly stem of Ren and the earthly branch of Zi are essential. This forms the foundational criteria. Should all additional criteria be satisfied beyond this foundation, it would merit a perfect score. However, deficiencies deduct points from the total, potentially reducing the score to 80 or even as low as 30.
For those born in the Year of the Monkey, September marks a significant turn in fortune, as they move past the challenging phase of "clashing with Tai Sui" to welcome a period of potent good luck. This transition is akin to receiving a boost from the "Year Lord," master of the earthly domain, ensuring smooth sailing and a surge in fortunate occurrences. A key aspect of this auspicious period is the "windfall wealth" star, enhancing financial prosperity. Success follows in both professional and business endeavors, with numerous unexpected financial blessings and opportunities for wealth accumulation. This phase also heralds thriving official fortunes, leading to celebrations of happiness, prosperity, and a life filled with contentment and luxury.

As a youth, I found solace in playing the qin to the rhythm of the rain from atop high buildings. In my prime, I wandered the lands, a figure of noble intent, my melodies spreading far and wide. Yet, one false step led to many, confining me within invisible bars. With age, as grayness adorns my temples, I listen to the rain beside a monk’s dwelling, pouring my heart into ink and paper, savoring a pot of freshly brewed wine and tea.
Ancient texts describe the qin's music as possessing a clarity and gentleness, embodying the ethereal and turbulent essence reminiscent of a dragon soaring through the skies and diving into deep gorges. Dragons are believed to return to the sea, symbolizing the melody's connection to the feather element, which is associated with water. The sublime beauty of qin music was once praised as capable of stirring the ancient dragons of the vast sea. The rendition by Mr. Yue Ying today captures this essence, presenting a rich and ancient tone, varied rhythms, and a profound attention to detail, evoking images of a rainy night by the river, a seamless blend of water and sky, and a majestic dragon ascending from clouds into the sea amidst rising winds and waves.
Shortly after the opening scene, the theater troupe's master recounts the tale of "Farewell My Concubine."
Master Hongyi reflected, "Ultimately, every relationship culminates in a mere acquaintance. Those who engage with intention will find themselves burdened, whereas the indifferent remain unaffected. Love arises voluntarily, without owing or being owed. A thought can bridge the distance as though it were but a step away; the absence of that thought turns even the closest reach into a vast divide."
Zhang Xian earned the posthumous nickname Zhang San Ying because of his verses "Clouds part to reveal the moon, casting shadows over flowers; where duckweed breaks, mountain shadows appear; shadows of a swing are sent across the wall." The recurrent theme of "shadow" (ying) in these lines deemed them exceptional, marking his enduring legacy in poetry.
Zhang Jiani's visit to the Crazy Horse Show was noticeably flamboyant, capturing attention with various photos and unexpected encounters. Following her appearance in a shared photo by the Crazy Horse Show, which left her unable to refute her attendance, the drama "Good Things Come in Pairs" ceased promoting her, even excluding her from new posters. Rumors suggest a potential second collaboration with Zhang Xiaofei might be reconsidered. Her discussions for a new drama have also stalled. This incident, however, doesn't significantly affect Zhang Xiaofei, who has already seen success with her latest project and is now concentrating on her next role.
Some argue that preseason games are meant for players to warm up and adjust, a routine Thompson has consistently followed. He typically spends the season's first half finding his rhythm before breaking out in the second. Indeed, Thompson's approach last season was to spend it seeking his form, culminating in a playoffs performance marked by numerous misses. This outcome illustrates the gamble of fine-tuning during regular-season games: a lack of precision is simply that. Despite this being just the preseason opener, I maintain my critique. Why? Since Paul's addition to the team, everyone has adapted except Thompson. Is this steadfastness or stubbornness? While some might see it as staying true to his roots, it parallels the behavior of certain Lakers players — in a word: isolationist.
Some netizens view Li Ximei's situation with a sense of detachment, arguing that if she consents, even if Da Shuang is motivated by her wealth, it's akin to the proverbial situation of Zhou Yu and Huang Gai — one eager to strike and the other ready to endure.
Peng Zu's cautions include: avoid making decisions about water on certain days as it’s harder to defend against mishaps; avoid leaving the noon sun uncovered as it increases the homeowner's distress; avoid going to the market when it's too full, as taking medicine then could lead to misfortune.

The desire for Buddha beads with noticeable flesh is considered an extravagant wish in today's context, as finding beads with natural wood grain patterns has become a rarity. The least desirable are even labeled as "toad back." There's a saying, "Choices are for children, adults want everything." Historically, collectors had limited options regarding the beads' aesthetic appeal, leading to the emergence of the "pure natural" trend out of necessity rather than preference. If the intricate grafting patterns available today existed back then, would "pure natural" still be as sought after? Today, the appeal of Buddha beads extends beyond their natural color variations to include the uniformity of patterns and the quality of carving craftsmanship. Despite nostalgic claims from seasoned collectors favoring the "pure natural" beads, the reality often reflects a hesitancy to purchase them, indicating a shift towards appreciating enhanced aesthetics and craftsmanship.
My only desire is for lovers to remember their affectionate words when love deepens, and to remain dependent on each other regardless of the distance that lies between them.
Cheng Yi and Li Yitong are set to collaborate once more in an ancient-themed drama, yet the sudden official announcement of "Wang Quan Pian" was unexpected. Cheng Yi's intricate ties with Chen Feiyu became more entangled following the casting shuffle in "Black Lotus," where Cheng was initially slated to replace Arthur amid a scandal. Despite the platform's interest in casting Cheng for his strong following, he declined due to the drama's poor reception and his own physical health issues. "Wang Quan Pian" initially featured Chen Feiyu alongside a newcomer, but underwent a significant cast overhaul at a pivotal moment.
I started experiencing a sore throat on the 2nd and by the 4th, I had a mild fever. Yesterday afternoon, my temperature surged to 39 degrees, prompting me to seek emergency medical care and IV treatment. This led me to cancel my ticket for today and, after realizing no tickets were available for tomorrow, I booked one for the day after. In a state of apprehension, I've requested leave from my supervisor, which remains pending approval (without approval, I'm unable to travel regardless).
The "Book of Later Han" documents the invention of paper, noting that historically, documents were primarily inscribed on bamboo slips, with silk and fabric occasionally used, termed as 'paper'. However, silk was prohibitively expensive and bamboo too cumbersome, posing inconvenience. Lun innovated (a term intriguing for its dual interpretation as both 'invention' and 'craft design') by utilizing tree bark, hemp fibers, old cloth, and fishing nets to create paper. This innovation was formally presented in the first year of the Yuanxing era.
I believe that overcoming external adversaries is simpler than conquering the foes within one's own heart.
During my night shift, I checked each patient room, including Wu Changjun in Bed 20, who immediately irked me upon sight. After leaving his room, I gestured towards the wheelchair by the door and asked Zhang Guihua if he felt sentimental. Guihua agreed. Acknowledging his perception, I remarked on the necessity of removing the clothing still inside, intending to conduct a physical examination. Wu Changjun's son-in-law then inquired about the situation, to which I explained my unfamiliarity with the individual he mentioned, cautioning him about prevalent scam tactics. He assured me of his vigilance. Shortly after, the clothing was removed, and the distinct sound of the wheelchair creaked again in the corridor.
I'm convinced that this particular film bears no relation to Chen Kaige. Considering his current projects, which strike me as overly affected, it's hard to believe they're from the same director who gave us "Farewell My Concubine".
My surname is Wu, with hands raised as if casting spells. My surname is Wu, quick to act and ready to dispute any challengers. My surname is Wu, draped in the national flag yet without medals. My surname is Wu, notable not for achievements but for presence on screen. What more endorsements does she need? It's wise to steer clear of controversy.
Our family dog, affectionately called Little Chicken Feather on the ninth lunar day, is truly a treasure. Whenever I'm away, it seeks comfort from my parents, but it shows loyalty only to me when I'm home, earning it the nickname "dog's leg" for its unwavering following. My father laments that I only remember him at meal times or walks. Firmly, it occupies my room in my presence, immovable, yet prefers my parents' room in my absence.
Being from Nanyang, you'd understand if you rented a fish pond or land there. They fish right before you, leaving you powerless to intervene, or worse, your fish end up poisoned if you do... A video shows a village woman climbing a wall to "collect" items, believing not in criminality but in finding discarded goods. The people remain unapprehended, continuing their justifications and defenses.
A typhoon is sweeping through Guangdong, bringing alternating bouts of wind and rain, fracturing the tranquil dreams of our hometown.
Navigating cautiously to avoid getting lost, I followed a tour group into the Zhenjing Luo Dongshu Memorial Temple. This temple spans four sections, and its ceremonial gates are divided into three entrances. The central gate, reserved for ancestral ceremonies of the Luo family or the arrival of distinguished guests, is adorned with a plaque and flanked by stone drum sculptures, known colloquially as "hudui." Supporting the plaque are "mendang," four short cylindrical pillars, a concept unfamiliar to me until then. The tradition of "mendang hudui" demands careful observance; regardless of an official's rank, "hudui" must not exceed half the door's height. The allocation of "mendang" follows strict regulations based on the official's rank, allowing only those of the third rank or higher to have four pillars, while royal relatives could have six. The Luo family, having reached the rank of Right Supervisor Imperial Censor, a second-rank position, qualified for four "mendang" pillars.
The question arises whether the formlessness of Vajrayana and the form of Pure Land can be integrated. I assert that the Diamond Sutra guides us to save all beings without attaching to the form of salvation. It advocates for generosity free from the five senses. As the primary virtue among the Six Perfections and all other practices, giving without attachment leads to adherence to precepts, patience, diligence, meditative concentration, and wisdom. Therefore, the Diamond Sutra encourages the practice of the Six Perfections and the universal salvation of all beings, acting as a comprehensive principle across all teachings of an era. This suggests that the formless and the form can coexist harmoniously. The Pure Land method is deemed supreme for liberation. To be reborn in the Pure Land, one must purify the mind, which in turn purifies the Buddha land. Reciting the Buddha's name with a mind free from attachment transforms the mind into Buddha. This path to rebirth in the Western Pure Land, achieving the patience of the uncreated, stands as an immutable truth, leaving no room for doubt.
Possibly drawing lessons from the precedents set by the Song and Jin dynasties, the Yuan dynasty appeared lukewarm towards the practice of "en yin" (hereditary privilege). Under the Yuan's "yin xu" system, a direct descendant of a top-tier (first class) official could be appointed directly to a fifth-class position, with subsequent generations receiving progressively lower rankings, down to the direct descendant of a fifth-class official being appointed only as low as the ninth class. However, direct descendants of officials ranked from the sixth to the seventh class were only eligible for "yin xu" appointments as money and grain officials.
Yamaha's strategic foresight in choosing powerful allies for partnership is proving to be quite discerning. Whether partnering with leading figures in distribution or top names in entertainment, it's clear that past experiences with competitors have instilled a cautious approach.
Whether it's a matter of endurance or a tactic to delay, if it weren't for the torment of witnessing widespread suffering, prolonging the conflict to discern the true strength of opponents and their economic resilience would be less concerning.

This auction piece showcases a representation of Tieguai Li characterized by a benevolent and compassionate demeanor, featuring a broad nose, substantial ears, and a gentle smile, looking off into the distance. His left leg is folded, with the right extended, and he gracefully holds a string of beads in his right hand, while his left cradles an alms bowl. Dressed in long, flowing robes that accentuate his lean frame, he bears a monk's hat and a staff tethered to a gourd on his shoulder, exuding an aura of ease. The piece's glaze is radiant and smooth, akin to jade, achieving a perfect harmony between the body and the glaze. Its vivid posture, meticulous craftsmanship, and the naturalistic flow of the robes, as if fluttering in the breeze, endow it with profound artistic allure.
The "Completion Records of Various Works" by the Qing Palace Workshops document: "On December 20th of Yongzheng's first year, Prince Yi submitted a request for a Ruyao round waist pen washer, to be adorned with a gold rim, as ordered. On December 28th of the same month, a Ruyao round waist pen washer with a gold rim, weighing 4.4 qian, was presented by Prince Yi." This indicates that during the Yongzheng era, there were indeed imitations of such artifacts.

Reflecting, I realize it has been thirteen Mid-Autumns since my business study trip to this gem of an island lasted a month. Residing in Yongkang City, Tainan, my explorations included the National Palace Museum and Taipei 101 in Taipei, Yehliu Geopark, Taichung's Chimei Museum, the Former British Consulate at Takao in Kaohsiung, Kenting's Baisha Bay, Eluanbi Lighthouse, Qixingtan Beach, and the Taroko Gorge in Hualien. My journey around the island by train and road also led me through various night markets and culinary delights.
Following Teacher Zhu Zheng's lead, participants shared recitations of nine poetic works from "Selected Poems of Xu Hongxiang on the Poetry Road".

In this formula, kudzu root serves as the chief herb, providing a balanced and light flavor profile that's both sweet and spicy, ideal for dispelling excess. Huanglian and Huangqin, with their bitter and cold nature, give the formula its cooling properties, balanced with sweetness and bitterness. Licorice harmonizes the middle burner, kudzu root facilitates the movement of qi, and Huangqin and Huanglian effectively clear heat from the middle burner.
For practitioners of the Tao, the priority lies in the practices of preserving essence, energy, and spirit; followed by solidifying these elements; and then replenishing them. The ultimate stage involves transforming essence, energy, and spirit. For middle-aged and elderly individuals with depleted vitality, focusing on the first three practices is crucial. Practitioners seeking to heal and extend life through minor Taoist cultivation should concentrate on the preservation and solidification stages to achieve lifelong health and longevity.
I have studied the "Biographies" and "Narratives" authored by my maternal uncle. His "Narratives" focus on the establishment of ancestral lands and the meticulous observance of rituals and funerals, underscoring the virtues of unity, familial harmony, filial devotion, and heartfelt sincerity. If one's discourse can lay the foundation for one's lineage, then their conduct can serve as a guideline for descendants. These actions embody the essence of establishing moral character, accomplishing commendable deeds, and advocating integrity. Which of today's scholars and dignitaries can uphold these ideals without bringing shame upon themselves?
Transitioning to a tech career from humanities is seen as "turning towards the light," while shifting from sciences to humanities is perceived as "losing one's way."
Since the holiday began, it's been ten days since I last saw Da Peng. An old saying claims, "A single day apart feels like three autumns have passed." With one autumn equating to three months, ten days would thus be akin to ninety months, or seven and a half years in total. "Seven years" indeed feels lengthy, yet I'm not troubled by the absence. Still, longing day and night, it's not just me who feels the void; even the refrigerator at home is left open, squandering electricity needlessly, a sin most grievous.
In this formula, Achyranthes bidentata (Niuxi) acts as the chief herb, facilitating the downward movement of blood, mitigating reverse blood flow, and nourishing the liver and kidneys. Hematite (Zhe Shi), Mother-of-Pearl (Zhen Zhu Mu), and Borneol (Bing Pian) function as deputy herbs. Hematite suppresses liver counterflow and stabilizes liver yang; Mother-of-Pearl enhances yin, suppresses yang, calms the liver, stops wind, pacifies the mind, and eases irritability; Borneol opens sensory orifices and revitalizes the spirit. Accompanied by Pinellia (Ban Xia) to dry dampness and transform phlegm, descending rebellious Qi and harmonizing the stomach; Pig Gallbladder Juice cools and moistens due to its bitter and cold nature; Wine Yeast (Jiu Qu) is included to harmonize the stomach, safeguarding the spleen from potential harm caused by Hematite and magnets. Together, these herbs synergistically work to regulate the liver, anchor yang, awaken the brain, soothe the spirit, and nourish the liver and kidneys. Contemporary studies indicate that the Brain Clearing Pill offers benefits like blood pressure reduction, sedation, anti-vomiting, and dilation of blood vessels.

Within the confines of a mere square inch lies an entire universe; the courtyard is strewn with fallen petals, painted in shades of tender green and dusky yellow, marking the fleeting moments of a beautiful day. Similar to the Lingering Garden, which has captured the hearts of many on social media, this single garden encapsulates the entirety of Suzhou's autumnal beauty.
Faced with no other choice, Ziroom is also exploring ways to overcome this deadlock.
Coincidentally, as Fushan Restaurant celebrated its 24th anniversary in 1949, another establishment serving royal cuisine, Tingli Hall, opened its doors in the Summer Palace. Originally a theater garden constructed during Emperor Qianlong's reign, it was razed by the Anglo-French Allied Forces in 1860. By the time of Emperor Guangxu, the Summer Palace had become the preferred residence of Empress Dowager Cixi. In the 18th year of Guangxu (1892), this theater garden was rebuilt on its original site, featuring a two-story stage labeled "Phoenix Soars with the Clouds" and "Clouds Follow the Sun" for regular performances.

When Prime Minister Li Fengji bore enmity towards Li Shen, intending to oust him, Li Shen was unexpectedly promoted to Jingzhao Intendant and also served as the Grand Imperial Censor. A special edict freed Li Shen from Grand Council sessions, while Li Fengji ironically made him the Deputy Minister of Personnel. Li Shen's impeachment of Li Yu, however, was nullified by a royal decree. Amidst ensuing strife and discord between the Prime Minister and the Grand Council, Li Yu was removed as the Minister of War and reassigned by Li Shen as the Inspector-General of Jiangxi. Yet, when Li Shen appeared before the emperor, he was retained, leading to Li Yu's reinstatement as the Deputy Minister of Personnel.

He outlined four levels of tea appreciation: "Fragrance," including floral and Xiao Zhong teas, considered the pinnacle of perfection by contemporary tea connoisseurs. Beyond fragrance, "Clarity" signifies purity, with fragrant but unclear tea being deemed ordinary. "Sweetness" surpasses clarity, with non-sweet fragrant teas labeled as bitter. The highest level, "Liveliness," transcends sweetness, where tea that is sweet but not lively is simply regarded as good tea.

Recently, an unstoppable trend has emerged in the Bodhi seed market, particularly with the Star and Moon Bodhi seeds. Once considered a tragedy in the Bodhi seed world due to a dramatic price fall caused by speculative revelations, these seeds have been inexpensive for ages. However, they're now on the verge of a major comeback. The buzz around the "Great White Space" demonstrates the evolving preferences within the Bodhi seed community—from seeking the aesthetic of a moonlit, starry sky with dense, white seeds, to valuing natural, unprocessed seeds, and then moving towards aged and jade-like seeds. Now, the "Great White Space" trend signifies a shift towards appreciating seeds with a pronounced white area, a concept encapsulating the latest peak in craftsmanship named "Ultimate White Space," indicative of this new preference.

Before visiting Shanghai, I attempted to book a spot at every popular Xing Rong Ji outlet but to no avail due to full reservations. Consequently, I opted for an affordable Michelin-starred heritage eatery. The entrance on Jinxian Road was modest, distinguished by a "Braised Pork" sign. The braised pork tasted similar to homemade, albeit sweeter, less sticky, and with chewier skin. "Sauce-Exploded Pig Liver" was sufficiently tender, balancing sweet and savory flavors. "Chicken Feather Vegetable" stood out as the sole non-sweet dish, offering a refreshing palate. Despite the small portion sizes, the predominant sweetness of the two meat dishes I chose became overwhelming, turning from initially pleasing to overly rich. Spending over 120 yuan on three dishes, I opted to order sparingly, fearing I couldn't finish more, which proved to be a prudent decision.

The speculation around the 4.2 gacha pool has dwindled, with rumors suggesting that the first character to become a permanent addition will only appear in the 4.3 gacha pool. This seems somewhat delayed compared to when characters typically join the permanent pool in other versions.

The community predicts Navia will join the permanent pool in the 4.3 update. It's high time for a rock-type character to become a permanent fixture.

The guqin piece "Hong of the Frontier" first appeared in the "Zhenchuan Zhengzong Qinpu" ("Authentic and Orthodox Qin Music Collection") compiled by Yang Lun during the Ming Dynasty, specifically within the volume titled "Boya Xinfa." According to Ji Fuxi's "Compilation of Ancient Qin Scores Seen and Preserved," there have been as many as thirty-three versions of this piece's music scores documented in later periods. Yang Lun, in his commentary on "Boya Xinfa: Hong of the Frontier," mentions, "This piece is believed to have been inspired by the sorrow for soldiers stationed at the frontier. The vast expanse of desolate autumn frontier, where yellow clouds stretch over a thousand miles, and the view is obscured by smoke and dust, the piercing west wind, and the desolate scenery evoke an intense sense of desolation. Observing the geese and wild ducks soaring above the blue sky, their mournful cries over the purple frontier lands, the soldiers, deeply entrenched in their duties, find no time for return. The emotions of those who resonate with this piece are profoundly stirred, leading to tears of empathy. The music, characterized by its mournful melody and sorrowful tunes, captures the essence of homesickness and patriotic sorrow felt by soldiers on distant frontiers. It stands as a pinnacle of expression within the guqin repertoire. This piece encourages careful listening and contemplation among those who share in these sentiments." Liu Su was responsible for transcribing this piece.

The "Treatise on Cold Damage Disorders" has a long history and various editions, leading to differing practices. One such debate is whether "Guizhi Jia Ge Gen Tang" (Cinnamon Twig plus Kudzu Root Decoction) includes "Ma Huang" (Ephedra). According to both practices, the preparation involves taking about ten liters of water, initially boiling Ephedra and Kudzu Root, reducing the volume by approximately 400ml, skimming off the foam, adding the remaining herbs, and boiling down to about 600ml, discarding the residue, and consuming a warm 200ml dose. This approach aligns with the distinct applications of Ge Gen Tang, intended for conditions without sweating and aversion to wind, and Guizhi Jia Ge Gen Tang, designed to induce sweating and expel wind, validating its preservation.

Embrace the masculine, yet adhere to the feminine, becoming the world's valley. In doing so, steadfast virtue remains, reverting to childlike innocence.

In such a way, enduring virtue suffices, returning to simplicity. From simplicity, tools are fashioned; in the hands of the sage, they fulfill roles of governance.

While the masses revel as if at a grand banquet or on a springtime platform, I stand alone, cautious and yet to emerge, aimless as if without a home.

At moments, I feel as boundless as the sea, adrift without anchor. While others find their purpose, I cling to a stubborn simplicity. Distinct from the rest, I cherish the maternal nourishment.

The beauty of simplicity is highlighted through the imagery of old trees, withered vines, dry brushes producing white strokes, and the erosion and fragmentation leading to a blurred and disintegrated appearance. Huang Tingjian advocated for simplicity over cleverness in calligraphy, favoring naturalness over deliberate adornment. Jiang Kui preferred clumsiness to skillfulness, strength over weakness, and speed over dullness, indicating a value in authenticity and rawness. However, with the Song Dynasty's publication and wide distribution of "Chunhua Pavilion Model Calligraphy," there was a shift towards valuing intricacy and flamboyance in calligraphy. The repetitive engraving process led to a dilution and distortion of the original works, causing a gradual decline in the appreciation for simplicity in the art form. This trend persisted through the Yuan and Ming dynies, showing a departure from the earlier values.

The Grain in Ear solar term signifies a crucial time for crop planting, marking a bustling phase of sowing, colloquially termed as "busy planting." Post this period, the viability of crop germination significantly drops. The saying, "Busy planting during Grain in Ear," encapsulates this wisdom. This time is pivotal for rice farming in the south and wheat harvesting in the north; with the south engaged in rice seedling transplantation and sowing, and the north in wheat gathering.
Underneath the blossoms, one finds admirers of Li Qingzhao, Zhang Ailing, and Xue Xiaochan, all united by their love for the crabapple and a preference for themes of springtime sorrow, melancholy, solitude, self-pity, and longing, where a gentle sadness often outweighs joy. To them, the bloom of the crabapple heralds a season of springtime sorrow—"so deep in melancholy dreams, even the oriole's cry is laden with grief." Many wish to dissipate the sorrows of separation and loss with the blossoms, imagining them as fragmented and drifting, as if only by consuming these flowers with poisoned wine under the dim moon can they combat poison with poison, or even heartache with heartache, refusing to easily let go.

Chrysanthemums boast yellow blooms. While most flora flourishes in sunlight, chrysanthemums thrive in shadow. Hence, while the hues of peach and paulownia remain unsung, it's the chrysanthemum's color that's celebrated, mirroring the earth's vibrance in autumn's prime.

The formula for Xuhanting granules originates from the Song Dynasty's "Taiping Huimin Heji Fang," specifically the Muli San recipe. The original formula and its application are as described: "Mix equal parts of Astragalus (cleansed of sprouts and dirt), Ephedra root (washed), and Oyster shell (soaked in rice wash, cleaned of dirt, and calcined to a reddish color), each weighing one liang. Grind these three ingredients into a coarse powder. For each dose, take three qian (approximately 9 grams) of this powder, add one and a half cups of water and a handful of wheat grains (over 100 grains), and decoct until the volume reduces by about one-eighth. Strain the decoction, consume warmly twice daily at any time."

In the west, a hammer swings swiftly, while in the east, another hammers even more rapidly. Is it that one hammer outpaces the other, or does one hammer's speed outshine another's slower pace? Perhaps one hammer's quickness surpasses all, yet, paradoxically, moves slower than the least swift.
In "Doubtful," enduring the day is akin to courting death. Centered on Zhao Zhuyi and Xu Jiashu's tale, a post-exam confession of love by Zhao to Xu inadvertently kindles a romance confined to a single day, shadowed by the belief that surviving it spells doom, against the backdrop of long-distance love's trials.

Ironically, the excessive inheritance system in the Northern Song Dynasty led to an abundance of officials, resulting in poverty and weakness, ultimately leading to their defeat by the Jin Dynasty. After the Jin Dynasty took control of the Central Plains, they continued to vigorously implement the "inheritance" system. The "History of Jin" recorded: "For officials of all ranks in civil and military positions, the inheritance extends to grandchildren and great-grandchildren, as well as brothers and nephews, up to six individuals, with five individuals through direct inheritance. For second-rank officials, the inheritance extends to grandchildren and great-grandchildren, as well as brothers and nephews, up to five individuals, with four individuals through direct inheritance. Third-rank officials have inheritance extended to grandchildren, brothers, and nephews, up to four individuals, with three individuals through direct inheritance. Fourth-rank and fifth-rank officials have three individuals, with two individuals through direct inheritance. Sixth-rank officials have two individuals, and seventh-rank officials have one individual from their children, brothers, or nephews, with one additional individual through direct inheritance for seventh-rank officials. According to the old system, only one individual from the children, brothers, or nephews would receive direct inheritance for seventh-rank officials, while the rest would have an additional individual. According to the Mingchang system, officials from the fifth rank and above would have one additional individual. For newly appointed officials, according to the old system, third-rank officials in the main category would have four individuals through direct inheritance, while those in the miscellaneous category would have three individuals. For military officials in the main category, one individual from their children, grandchildren, brothers, or nephews would receive direct inheritance."

Located on Yuquan Mountain's southwest ridge, Shang Yu Lou is encircled by pines and bamboos, providing panoramic views beyond the garden—a pivotal passage from the West Gate.

His "Shang Yu Lou" poem captures its essence: atop the peak, the building stands gracefully, amidst inspiring landscapes, welcoming the sunset's embrace and the verdant touch upon the stairs, a sanctuary for reflective indulgence.

Six days have passed since Li Jiaqi's contentious comments, and the repercussions persist. The backlash against Li Jiaqi has also ignited debates around national cosmetics brands, dubbing Chanel as an alternative to Huaxizi, unexpectedly causing a run on Chanel's loose powder. Numerous local brands are capitalizing on this, banding together in a coalition. The trend has extended to both individual and retail broadcasts. Many items from Beijing Union Medical College’s “Jingxin” line have sold out, with live streams dedicated to national products showcasing everyday activities.

Over the holiday, I opted for "Mission: Impossible 7" and a couple of indie horror flicks at home over traveling or cinema trips. It's been about ten years since I last engaged with domestic films and dramas, finding them difficult to enjoy. The domestic audience's taste seems lackluster, with overhyped films like "Fengshen," a movie that, despite its collective acclaim, I find barely merits a 2 out of 10.
"Longing for You," featuring Yang Zi, showcases her flawless portrayal amidst three romantic storylines.

What kind of friends are these? Not "The Legend of Zhen Huan," "Empresses in the Palace," nor "Story of Yanxi Palace" can match the drama of a parents' group chat.
At that moment, inside the Zixiao Palace, several burly men with scarred faces were drawing divination sticks. "The worst possible fortune! What kind of terrible fortunes does this temple have! To draw such a bad fortune! I'll tear this place down!" After uttering these words, one of the men violently threw the stick container at the statue before him. Suddenly, a shadow flashed, catching the container mid-air and sending the man flying with a powerful kick. This shadowy figure was a Taoist priest on duty that day.
The rubbings and tracings of this oracle bone piece were first documented in Zeng Yigong's "Compendium of Oracle Bone Inscriptions". The rubbings are shown on the front as figure 32 and on the back as figure 33 of the book; the tracings appear on page 304 as piece C, described as "Rubbing by Luo", and combined with two other "Rubbing by Luo" pieces A and B. "Collected Oracle Bone Inscriptions" 9681 follows this compilation. Upon review, the combination does not seem to match the original edges and shape of the scapula accurately, indicating a possible error. Thus, our discussion will focus solely on figures 32 and 33, or page 304C, excluding pieces 304A and B.

It's not just about the cost; it's about the principle. Doubling water and electricity rates to 40 yuan per ton and constantly citing repairs—it seems like an everyday affair. These are school facilities we've barely used for a few years. Considering the air conditioning rental alone, we could have bought a new unit with the four-year rental fee. Overcharging seems to be a norm, but profiting unjustly should worry you about karma. Don't expect sympathy from alumni when troubles arise. It's just wrong.
Upon entering the Jia Mansion, I was met with constant challenges. The servants looked down upon me, seizing every chance to kick me when I was down. Their care was half-hearted at best, accompanied by frequent snide comments.

Luhun Villa, located on the banks of the Yishui River in Luhun County to the southwest of Luoyang, was Song Zhiwen's villa. This villa, where Wang Wei resided in his later years, had previously belonged to Song Zhiwen. Wang Wei's fondness for Song Zhiwen's villa stemmed not only from its scenic beauty but also from Song Zhiwen's exceptional poetry on reclusion. The poem reflects the idyllic and tranquil scenery the poet encountered upon his arrival at Luhun Villa during the Cold Dew season. Liu Xie praised Song Zhiwen in "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons" for his ambition and the breadth of his poetic expressions, which is an apt commendation.

Chen Yongqing, an adept potter originally from Wuyuan, Anhui, flourished during the transition from the Ming Wanli era to the Qing Shunzhi period. Commonly nicknamed "Chen San Daizi," he shared the stage with the esteemed Shi Dabin, both renowned for their craftsmanship. Chen's creations, ranging from lotus seeds to soup pots, bowls, and beads, were known for their meticulous attention to detail and exquisite design. Despite their unconventional shapes, these pieces were beautifully adorned, drawing inspiration from Zhong Yao's calligraphy but executed with a distinctively clumsy ink and precise knife work.

When a sparrow ventures into the vast sea, it transforms into a clam. The sparrow, a diminutive bird with various species, in this case, refers specifically to a yellow sparrow. Here, 'the big water' symbolizes the sea.
Sparrow, also a small bird, there are different types, this is a yellow sparrow. Large water, the sea, as mentioned in the "Guoyu": sparrows entering the sea become clams. It is because of the severe cold wind that many sparrows enter the sea. They transform into clams, flying creatures turning into hidden creatures. Clams belong to the family of clams, and this one is small.

Yingchuan Diffractive Branch brings attention to two hidden gems I've treasured: one in Quanzhou city center, where my parents dined during their teaching college days at Dongxing Beef Noodle Shop. The noodles mixed with rich black sesame paste, peanut butter, and sweet spicy sauce are incredibly aromatic. Another lies within the old streets of Magnetism Town in Jinjiang, featuring savings noodle paste. It's run by the owner during the day and assisted by his son in the evening after closing the stall. Their deep-fried vinegar pork offers a unique taste that no other place can replicate – a flavor I've cherished since childhood.
