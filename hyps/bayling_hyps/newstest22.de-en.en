The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the wholesale value...
I am a large customer of #PRS_ORG# and therefore it is not a problem for me.
Just need a tracking number or instruction on how to label the package so it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG a few days ago... for €249.
Today it costs €179.
I find that very annoying to be honest.
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to get the refund?
I also fundamentally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is good for big brothers and sisters to look after the little ones to a certain extent.
Look for a moment, help for a moment, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help out in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still have children, I don't see a problem there.
If your K1 is occupied for a short time and it is OK for him, then that is good.
You are best placed to judge whether this is suitable for your children.
It is not so that he should wrap K2 and accompany him in sleep for hours.
It is probably legally dubious.
This is where the psychologist comes in.
Because if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion etc. it would be too much responsibility for K1 to look after K2.
Whether that now is a risk you are willing to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to mind - perhaps someone here knows what it is?
The history is about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself in feed and going into the enclosure with the big cats.
The case is taken up by a commissioner, who, after a short investigation, turns to his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and goes to this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of the suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet.
At any rate, it turns out that this therapist is running some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that creates an anxiety center in the brain, and the patients are forced to confront their fears in the most extreme way possible.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to her death)
This is described in the book as "the fight."
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that was set on fire.
That is the rough plot I am pretty sure the book was written by a French author/writer.
If this action is known to someone or if someone even knows the title of the book I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the wifi password to hand.
First I have to contact my husband.
But that can take time.
What steps do I need to take next?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, aged 4, splitter under the little finger nail
Kind, aged four, had splinters of wood under his fingernail (on the outside).
They tried to pull him with a tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work out and I got hurt.
Now the child is hysterical when we try to do it.
No chance.
Tomorrow I go to the doctor.

Due to Omikron: Johnson wants to press ahead with booster vaccinations
New Omega cases are causing concern in politics and science in the UK.
By New Year's Day, all eligible adults in England will have been offered the jab.
London - The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, wants to move faster than ever before with the COVID-19 vaccinations, given the rapid increase in Omega numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to have a booster by the end of the year, provided they have had at least three months since their second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to the nation on Sunday evening.
Up until now the target date has been at the end of January.
The UK Government will also provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the Omicron variant, man is confronted with an emergency, which means that the vaccination protection must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be raised again with a third jab.
Let's get boosting now, said Johnson.
Another 1,239 cases of Omikron were registered in Great Britain on Sunday, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, that was an increase of a mere 65 percent.
Will the full amount be refunded of the purchase price upon collection?
I'm all for everyone using pronouns
I sent in an application.
Today, the invitation came via email.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
However, unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and according to where he/she has a cultural background from, it's either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on the toes of any officials.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have 5 books in total.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Clearly the chair had a non-visible defect when sold.
How can a mattress stain appear after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS_ORG.
However, this has been the case since approximately
14 days to go.
That's why I've been buying the last few books from the website and then reading them on the #PRS_ORG.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, they were no longer available.
Now they are back in stock and I would like to add 2 chairs to my order and charge it to my account.
[CW] The feeling of not being able to help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write a bit more about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something from my soul.
I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A theme that really nags at me and unfortunately comes up far too often is that many victims don't help themselves or think we can't help them.
It is clear to me that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in those situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social circle, fear of taking the children away from this.
What I want to make clear to everyone is that, partly because I am very close to tears myself, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to just take abuse.
I often wish I could help in any way... I know I can't.
However, it will never be light.
Please remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so important.
Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series have to do with "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking opening: "Arcane," the series set in the "League of Legends" video game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the hands of Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick was able to rely on Verlass.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said, looking back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
After the game, however, they did not throw in the towel - quite the opposite, in fact, given the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the German basketball league.
More than the bare result, the manner of the performance was a disappointment.
To illustrate the dilemma, a statistic is cited: just 13 per cent of shots were on target, four goals (all from youngster Johannes Patrick) from 31 attempts - any more questions?
The response came from John Patrick: "We just weren't focused enough after winning in Tenerife and didn't do what we practised".
In other words, to move the ball.
His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, had a completely different reaction: "It's great to win a second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
He felt like he was in front of 10,000 people.
On Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, only 750 spectators were admitted, but they came at their own expense.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and steered his team's game.
The best playmaker I have ever coached, praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team, the performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) on the whole line failed.
Only in the final quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a complete debacle, coming within eight points after being 39:59 down.
Alongside Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to brood.
Already on Wednesday (8:00 p.m.), the Giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then playing in Ludwigsburg in front of a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected there.
We have re-checked our legal position and have written to them again.
We registered about half a year ago.
Always like out of an egg: Max Raabe will be 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
At the moment he is travelling with the programme "Good morning, dear luck" - if he is allowed to appear.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing came of it.
The planned concert has been postponed until May 2022 - "on the instructions of the authorities" - in order to combat the Coronavirus.
Other planned appearances in the run-up to Christmas will also have to be postponed, according to the website of the 59-year-old singer and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists will then pick up the dates they postponed back in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12th December 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing since he was a youngster.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has won many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts, just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with blonde hair slicked back and a keen eye for detail, Max Raabe is no longer a figure that can be ignored in the current German-language music scene.
Since 2020, he has been touring with the programme "Good morning, dear luck". dpa

Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Nationalisation does not create new homes
New Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a popular initiative in Berlin.
A compulsory purchase will not create a single new home, it will only change the ownership structure, said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My aim is to give tenants peace of mind that their rent will remain affordable over the next few years.
A mix of private landlords, cooperatives and housing associations, for example, is the best protection against monopolies.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and the Left Party will set up an expert commission to determine how to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not ruling out discussions with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement envisages rent controls until 2029, limits on rent increases in overheated housing markets, and an expansion of the rental sector.
I will be talking to the Attorney General to see if we can expedite that as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not improve despite this, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," stressed the SPD politician.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have moved across the U.S.
More than 100 could be dead in Kentucky alone.
The pictures from there remind you of a war zone.
Several tornadoes tore through the U.S. overnight Saturday, causing widespread damage and possibly killing as many as 100 people.
The storms are leaving a roughly 230-mile path of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster zone that everything was gone, everywhere the tornado went.
Homes, shops, government buildings - just get rid of them.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to believe that this is even possible.
He estimates that as many as 100 people died in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official death toll is rising by the hour.
Hey, I just saw that the display case #NAME# is sold out.

If the delivery cannot be brought to my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the ceiling and have it delivered to Germany from the shopping basket?
I had sent an article back via the contact form, or abandoned a return, and wanted to ask whether it had arrived or been processed, as I had not yet received any confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccine bounties and changing ad copy
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine reward, companies in Austria have taken matters into their own hands, offering their employees money to get vaccinated.
They are on the same line as the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber for Industry and Commerce, who today are calling for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German example - is also intended to increase the readiness for Corona vaccinations.
He moved to a company that he had lashed out at.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It's been a year.
He has clearly not stuck to his old job and has been looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: who cares.
He did not find his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the max!
I'm currently running an adventure for a group of 4 friends over the Greifenpass and I want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written especially for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are designed and now I am writing the opening adventure and stumble already over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are to transport a cartload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Thuran Lake.
Further action is to take place there.
Some miles away from the village, a group of goblins ambush and lure the hero into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threaten, detect danger early on, whatever the players come up with.
Group size: 8 normal goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords.
If unnoticed, the Goblins lie in wait for the hero in a sunken lane, armed with bows, and flank the wagon from left and right, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all knocked unconscious and subsequently found and revived by the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, long gone.
If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf and two of his knights leap to the hero's aid.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How do you justify your Deus ex Machina solution 2?
Is the encounter too much of an adventure starter?
The Goblins group will later play a decisive role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I had not expected so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee that many of your ideas will come to fruition and now I also have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put them back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd love to send them back
Can you then send the returns, then I can package the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm bored of Sky Sports F1
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality of the German Sky has been deteriorating more and more, so I wanted to take a little break with this post.
First of all, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today, in order to start the F1 pre-coverage punctually.
Although the start was delayed and there was an accident, the schedule was far behind the plan, but they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
However, it seems that, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to give way to it, which is why Sky DE had no choice but to show it.
Nevertheless, dumb, especially as Sky UK have shown the race highlights.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator, Olivier Zwartyes, accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was a lapse in understanding of the rules by commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, who did not know that you can change your tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone earlier this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change his tyres when Hamilton received relevant radio messages on this topic.
Both Sky UK and RTL commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had the option.
I am of the opinion that one should simply know such basic rules if one is commentating on a pay-TV F1 channel.
It's also not the first riddle that is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainties about the rules.
In general, Roos does not like the artificial commentary style, but acknowledges that it is a matter of taste.
But seriously, I like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
There are also constant yawns, which make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee with reporter Peter Hardenacke (who is equally clueless) or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular is causing a lot of commotion in the comments, which he doesn't seem to be taking seriously.
Not least, advertising is simply taking over at Sky, in the closing stages, Sky is the only channel that goes to advertising, on F1TV, you can only listen to the German commentary, without commentary, directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also do less advertising than Sky, and as free-to-air channels.
While one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 schedule is also very sparse and full of repeats.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster of F1.
In a tongue-in-cheek move, RTL are doing a better job of covering the four races they are still allowed to show.
So anyway, the grandiose F1 season is a lot less fun than it could be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendant light, brass and multi-coloured glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it would be sent Monday, the second lady told me yesterday she was going to review and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short period (the substance has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I beg for support.
Air pumps are ideal for adding oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to drive a filter system using an air pump.
This series will be offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the bottom of the table.
There you can compare performances.
If the pumps are strong enough, the whole plant can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect more than one outflow.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. However, fans are also available for use in aquariums to create a focal point, for example with an air curtain (find them in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here a treasure chest, mussel or similar could be mentioned.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed construction, which ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The blower pump is connected to an exhaust pipe 4/6 mm via an air hose ... and then it can get going.
The blower pump should be the same, or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the blower pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between the blower pump and the water level.
Cut the air hose in two and put the valve between them.
This would prevent water from flowing backward, which would cause water from the basin to flow through the pump...
If the fan is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other fans, be covered and protected from moisture.
MK series pumps are pure power packages that use little energy
While we list the processing time here on ebay as 3 days, the parcels are packed daily and collected daily from here.
If everything is going well when travelling, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take a little bit of a bow, so that nobody is upset, just because it took a little bit longer.
That's how it is, not everyone has sympathy for all the employees who also work in the logistics sector...obviously, here, no-one is stopping for Corona.
Please do not rate us poorly just because the delivery is delayed, this is down to the courier service.
Of course people like to moan about these services, even though at the moment we are saying...they are struggling
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope there are better days ahead.
how long does it take to order the yellows with and without armrests?
Were you also able to order the legs in bright colours here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and TV presenter into space
The daughter of the first US astronaut in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the Blue Origin company, founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.
The take-off and landing of the roughly ten-minute flight took place in the western US state of Texas.
Under a clear blue sky, Bezos warmly welcomed back the newly selected astronauts.
Welcome back, Bezos said, wearing a blue jumpsuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were in the air for ten minutes and thirteen seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV personality Michael Strahan were VIP guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much each of them paid for their tickets, Blue Origin wouldn't say.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He has had to work hard and do everything himself.
She was just along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would love to go back to space again, the presenter said.
New Shepard will fly to an altitude of 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" rocket system is flown largely on autopilot.
The capsule detached from the rocket during flight and reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned test flight: the first in July saw Amazon founder Bezos on board, along with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was there, as was former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's vice president Audrey Powers.
Critics say Bezos and Blue Origin are pushing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the betterment of humanity and with little regard for the climate.

Someone who works or studies biochemistry
I'm currently in my first semester studying biochemistry and I must say, the subject itself is quite interesting and in the lab, I'm not bothered by anything (I've already completed my organic chemistry practical).
I had of course already done some research on career prospects before starting my studies, but at the time I also still thought that I would definitely study for my doctorate and become a professor.
But at the moment I have doubts, especially about the job prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you constantly hear about great career opportunities and the profession is totally in demand, on the other hand you constantly hear about unemployed biologists and extremely poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really like to know:
What are you working on at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What have you studied/What training have you had?
Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm currently really unsure and I'm considering breaking off my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as a computer specialist.
If you have any experience in this field, please write it down :)
Extra stress over holiday and weekend getaways
This came up for me last week.
However, I had to make use of my long weekend to relax.
Only now are they putting a post in.
It's not just the big holidays, like Christmas, that cause stress at work.
It seems there are also holidays before holidays plus bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was the Feast of the Assumption, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses will take a bridge day, which is semi-official.
It was a long four-day weekend last week.
What happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Loads of e-mails that had to be dealt with before setting off, jobs here, jobs there, everything *had* to be done before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "next week then" after so much time sounds wrong and it shouldn't?
Or is it because people want to get as much done in a shortened week as they would in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also extremely nervous.
What is this self-imprisonment for holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we can't give them to ourselves?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent like that.
My question is simply: Are we the only ones like this, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
The beautiful, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then you simply drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will participate in the festival by baking and basting with her son.
I love that, said Catterfeld.
However, she still has a lot to do before Christmas: "For the first time I haven't got any presents, I have to get on with it now".
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth moulting and feather regrowth in mice.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON Bio provides the bird with a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of feather damage occurring in aviculture is attributed to nutritional deficiencies.
Since the feathers are made of protein substances, a particularly rich and balanced diet of protein is necessary for the formation of a flawless feather.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large proportion of the bird losses that occur during the moult are due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of Nekton Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of Nekton Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or animal feed.
Thank you, I found it.
Still not working
DDR-handmade vintage E-lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the loco was in use in Silesia and central Germany, the very rare loco probably originates from the conversion proposal in the model railway enthusiast's magazine ME Heft 11/1968, it is complete with play tracks and missing parts, see photos, it is in good working order, the E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also originates from the small-scale manufacturer ZS
One locomotive is in the DB Museum in Halle (Saale) and has been restored to operational condition.
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to come up with proposals for an electric locomotive that could haul 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a speed of 45 km/h.
A maximum speed of 65 km/h was required.
Therefore, in March 1926, the DRG decided to deliver the locomotive as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager drive, supplied by AEG with the mechanical part, and by Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were supplied, which were given the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All of them survived the Second World War and found themselves on the territory of the former GDR afterwards.
In 1946, the locomotives were transferred to the Soviet Union as war reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk (Imperial Railway Repair Shop) in Dessau, the reparability of all six locomotives was established.
[4] As the electrification of the middle German network progressed, there was an increasing need for locomotives for heavy goods traffic. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were overhauled, with the remaining machines serving as spares.
Firstly, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are available in large quantities, were preferred for construction.
When it became clear that the number of repairs on the E 94 could not be increased any further, the E 95 came into focus for refurbishment.
The locomotives were initially stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway workshop.
They came to the railway workshop in Halle P in 1960.
They were used in their own timetable, mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
As the age of the locomotives increased, the complex control systems became problematic.
So it was not uncommon for shooters to stay put during ceasefires.
Then Beimann, who was always travelling on this locomotive, had to hammer and chisel the gunner back into shape during the journey.
Engine damage was a frequent occurrence and resulted in the locomotive being out of service for several months.
[5] By the end of the 1960s, there were enough new build locomotives available and there were no plans to extend electrification at that time, so the Bundesbahn was able to do away with old locomotives and most of the split-gauge types, so the E 95s were taken out of service.
They added that the German Federal Railway only wanted to operate electric locomotives with a single crew, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the cab.
[5] After mid-1969, the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service, followed by the E 95 01, which retired on 5 October 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a signal heater in the main train station in Halle.
It was not until some time later that the railway authorities were convinced that the E 95 was worthy of preservation as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external restoration of the locomotive began with the aim of presenting it at a vehicle show in RAW Dessau.
Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive was carried out.
The locomotive is looked after by the DB Museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community of Bw Halle P have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was able to be presented to an exhibition in the Museum Bw Arnstadt for the first time, with a new internal and external livery, where the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and its branch lines until 1945, where they proved their reliability and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were moved to Leipzig, to the central German network.
Their main area of operation was initially Silesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, functioning well, optical repairs to the loco done in-house, dirty, with ballast, musty smell!!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also came from the small-scale firm ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may bear labels and storage marks.
Yes the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with some of them.
The central beam is held by two feet. Unfortunately, these feet are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on them.
What are we going to do now?
I can't build the bed.
The central beam is held up by two feet, which unfortunately were produced incorrectly.
The central beam does not fit into the planned support.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they then be sent out?
no flats.
According to the instructions for assembly, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow
But who cares?
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
They're not flat for me
Could you have sent this to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Dwelling fire with two minor injuries and significant damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated amount of damage in the six-figure Euro range has occurred, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire is said to have spread from a carport onto the neighbouring house in Kinsau (Landsberg district).
Two residents were taken to hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday, according to the statement.
The precise cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not rule out the possibility of it having been set deliberately.
The Criminal Investigation Department in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
However, it arrives much later.
And I have to pay shipping again
To counter fake news - Biotech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin shared a photo of his first vaccination on LinkedIn earlier this year
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has not yet made any public statements about his vaccination status.
Now the businessman has shared a photo of himself receiving the Coronavirus vaccine.
A friend's illness prompted him to do it, Şahin shared.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech Pfizer vaccine," wrote Sahin on LinkedIn Friday.
For months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter the fake news.
Up until now he has rejected it because the communication shouldn't revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to hear that an old school friend is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, continued Şahin.
He did not ask why.
But the most common seems to be fear, often stoked by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear is hard to combat with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
An interview with German World Service is doing the rounds on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the German World Service itself clarified.
At the moment it is not legally possible for me to get the vaccine myself, said Şahin at the time.
There is a prioritization of vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile, prioritisation has long been a thing of the past – and according to his own information, the biontech boss has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Ten thousand people without power
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and, in many cases, no heating.
A fire had knocked out a substation.
After a fire with severe damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire caused the lights to go out for 41,000 affected residents and inhabitants in several communes on Friday evening.
Supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the large-scale disturbance was finally completely repaired late in the evening.
Firefighters and members of the THW provided support in the communities.
Authorities offered counselling places in schools and appealed for help from the community.
The provider expressed gratitude to those affected for their patience and to the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant disruption.
We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless work," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz installers were initially only able to put some cables back into service provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical fault led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
According to information from Westnetz, the fire that broke out at around 19:15 on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There, expensive cleaning and repair works are necessary.
A connection to a 30,000-volt level has also been created.
With the help of this bypass, power supply has been restored.
Since 6:00 p.m. on Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9.30 p.m.
Since 9.15 p.m. electricity has also been restored to those who had been affected by the outage.
More than 80 Westnetz and partner company fitters were deployed.
Following the construction of emergency power supplies for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for help from the local community.
What is important now is that citizens take care of their neighbours, the elderly or people living alone, and inform the local fire station if help is needed, said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) following a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the residents of nursing homes were the main focus.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed electrical medical devices or medical care.
Good morning!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the daytime ceiling #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a lovely day too and stay safe ♡
But I can't mount it under the desk.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 explanations.
We wanted those with table top diameters of #NUMBER#
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# came in, however, I can't push and thus shorten this.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would be delighted to receive a response
That is really easy!
Then we'll do it!
Can you send me the return form by post?
repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before purchasing.
Should I do that now?
I find it almost shameful to have such a low credit balance.
We are not in agreement with that
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber wins
German nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have made it onto the podium in the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo once again had to give way to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had started the cross-country race with a large lead after the ski jumping.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be refunded to my account?
Yes, we both started over and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard of the problem
Just bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG, it seems to like it too.
If I want to open it, the message pops up, oh no!
This document cannot be opened.
The file may be faulty, they report to the customer service.
As far as I can tell it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me further?
Chat connection is down and now what?
I also have to work in between!
To ensure that the powder coating is applied evenly and cleanly, you should clean the parts with soapy water to remove dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse them with clear water and dry them.
Before you dip your brush into a new color for the first time, it's a good idea to practice 2-3 strokes.
You can do this on the non-visible inner side of the components or on a yoghurt pot.
The first stroke on the building component
Draw the pencil evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the colour layers ensures a uniform surface later.
Avoid wiping quickly with the brush.
This leads to areas that look unrealistic.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colours.
The dark ones could come through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colours come to a head with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can lead to unsightly metallic streaks when mixed with normal colours.
Leave the painted parts to dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve their original appearance through decals or stickers.
From airplane emblems to ship names to license plates on automobiles: Decals give the model the final touch.
Put the decals on in the right order while the parts are still accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be or can be more easily built before it is fitted into the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and pincettes are time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and apply them to your model.
Decals are also called water transfer decals, because you wet the back of the decal for a few seconds until the carrier paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then you just peel the image off the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you are holding the decal on the model with a tool, you are pulling the carrier paper sideways away.
Attention: Always check that the picture is sitting properly on the paper before you try to remove it completely from the paper, so that it doesn't stick, knit or even tear.
Scrape off excess water with a towel.
Not suitable for children under 3
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look at something else, I can't read the book any more and have to log out and log in again and load the book again and find the place where I left off reading.
AM I communicated with you already on Saturday.
Will I get this via email?
For all three packages?
Because the lamp came to me in three separate packages
Thank you anyway!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
However, will I get it back without any problems?
Infertility treatment for PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for a while, now that we have to deal with the PKV, suddenly this pops up.
In order:
We had applied for the desire to have children in advance with the PKV, and we were promised three attempts.
The attempts were in no way restricted (e.g. in terms of time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the PKV.
A few months later we tried for a second child and had 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these as a miscarriage.
We applied again for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were again allowed 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we've done more than we said we would, logically the most expensive ones with the PKV are the ones we've done) we sent in the bills to the PKV and got the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV will only pay for 3 attempts.
The justification: With the pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first promise are lost.
The second pregnancy is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "The insurance period begins with the commencement of treatment, and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
Who has the right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or us (there are 5 attempts to be refunded)?
Did the PKV have to point out to us in the agreements that with a birth the subsequent attempts would fail?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance claim?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can achieve them best again
Fine.
We will no longer order anything from them.
When they add up sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address) they've obviously lost a good customer.
They would like to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund was initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
Well, I can't do anything about the fact that the wardrobe is completely trashed when it arrives with me
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
It is clear and obvious that the refund was requested and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG
They can tell their manager they've lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We will no longer be doing that.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise they are not allowed to sell him as an office chair.
Regardless, the 24-month warranty applies.
No, I am unable to obtain any other type of packaging.
I will take the cupboard down and make it available to the transport company.
Good morning, I have a question about your #PRS_ORG series.
These products are advertised with additional purchasing hooks, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
What a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What is it about?
And what perhaps you don't like at all?
Have been a very good customer of yours, have already had 2 flats completely furnished with your furniture.
Wanted to get the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now reliable?
Thank you very much
Sincerely,
If there is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait for 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I give up soon after because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello
'Halving' victory against Belarus comes at high cost for EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Protestant Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation in a sustainable manner, explained the researcher at the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus isn't giving up without a fight, but the EU feels it's in the driving seat - looks set to continue for a while yet.
The treatment of people on the border is not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong.
Clearly there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not prepared to take a stand against it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union.
She can't get her way when a member state gets it into its head to do its own thing," like Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to its borders.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, says Bossong: a basic agreement on asylum policy is made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempt to cross the border again
According to information from the Polish border guards, migrants have once again attempted to enter Polish territory from Belarus.
55 migrants were detained overnight on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokesperson for the authorities said on Sunday.
Polish officials were pelted with stones near the town of Czeremsza by migrants.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had managed to overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months.
The EU is accusing Alexander Lukashenko of being the ruler in Minsk, luring them with the prospect of visa-free travel to the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened to ban airlines from flying migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to countries of origin to prevent people leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
So the EU has thrown its weight around the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.
Minsk must also take into account the internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is unlikely to be prepared for the security service to regularly herd thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finish
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suggest two rule breaches in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The protest relates to a perceived infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last safety car period, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second objection was lodged against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed correctly.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the final lap to take his first Formula 1 title.
The move came just after the end of a safety car period, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I check that.
I'm talking to the bank and re-registering myself with you
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europe Park is organising a SC Freiburg fan day
The Europa Park, the name giver for the Europa Park Stadium of the Sport Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the press release, members of the Sport Club from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit the Europa Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains were wearing red and white stripes that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The collaboration between the Bundesliga club and the holiday camp, which is located in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa Park, it was once again demonstrated how well the partnership fits.
Seeing shining fans having fun on the rollercoaster confirms that," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is that €#NUMBER# and not €1699€ like originally?

I had a huge argument with you back then when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# cabinet.
Judith Hermann reads from her novel "Heim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her latest novel, "Daheim", in the sold-out Blue Note on Friday, and also acted as the moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and listens attentively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I left a contact form for returning an item yesterday but have not received any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time to deal with your cluttered chat and misdelivered cheap goods from China.
Their error, which they are correcting and not all from our budget.
Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted and agreed yesterday that I/Ms. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS_ORG# Night Table and a return label.
This e-mail has not arrived yet.
The package wants to bring #PRS_ORG today.
Please contact me.
Sincerely,
The LokSound 5 decoder can reproduce up to 10 channels simultaneously.
Each channel can be resolved here with up to 16 bits / 31250 kHz and finally offers HiFi quality on your system.
It is practically indistinguishable from the original.
A Class-D audio power amplifier with an output power of up to 3W is used to drive the speakers, which must have a impedance of between 4 Ohm and 32 Ohm.
The huge 128 MB sound memory provides enough capacity.
Every single sound can be individually adjusted in volume.
The super-flexible sound engine without a rigid timetable enables the realistic simulation of all conceivable rail vehicles.
Three separately adjustable braking functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicle.
But only because he says he is not an anti-Semite does this mean nothing.
It's like when an AfD politician says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it alone.
Yes, wow, then you are just as unserious as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the fundamentals of evolution is simply completely lost.
In any case, a god has set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist you have to believe the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just a pack of lies.
And with that you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of view, the microscope should be as close to the eye as possible.
The special apochromatic-achromatic lens system enables you to use the microscope almost error-free, right up to the edge of the field of view.
Often scopes will have magnification markings.
However, this applies only to conditions that are set down exactly, which are rarely the same as the conditions of use.
In order to use your magnifier to its full potential, please note the specifications in the "Technical Data" table (see the user manual in the packaging).
On the surface of the lenses of all optical devices - including slit lamps - light reflections occur.
Anti-reflective coatings reduce these reflections considerably.
Reflections on the lens surface become less noticeable if the loupe is held close to the eye.
Further information can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Hello lovely #PRS_ORG# team,
I have already registered with you under customer contact #PHONENUMBER#
Yes, but that was before.
They can't deliver to #PRS_ORG from England.
Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farm owner Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations when selling beech wood.
Once, a man drove home alone because he and his partner couldn't agree on anything.
He plants around 2000 of them every year.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations.
This always makes the pre-Christmas period a bit of fun, he says.
And the voucher?
Otherwise I'm a customer?!
Nevertheless, I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price.
Then I will also rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have a debate here about the better restaurant, but there is a similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both have therefore been named.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with glass fibre + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, now I have problems setting up a stable Wifi network.
Previously I had a 50 Mbit DSL connection and used the Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly, receiving and sending 50 Mbit.
The new fibre optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives these.
However, at the other DLan module, which transmits Wi-Fi, the full 500 no longer come, but the less I move away from the module (i.e. a socket which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module) the less comes.
This means that, with the new fibre-optic connection, the internet is now slower on the first floor than it was before (\~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
While this was slightly better than the DLan, there were still significant losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost with glass fibre over the power cable?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to move the LAN cables in that house.
I'm really at my wit's end, which is why I made a special account here.
That's why I would love to hear an answer.
When is it time to change your current account?
Anyone who thought that they could now take a breather with the Giro accounts is in for a surprise.
While many banks have taken advantage of the autumn to get their customers to confirm the fee increases of the past once again, the allowance for negative interest rates is also being reduced.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of €100,000.
Now she has halved her free bet allowance and even quartered her daily allowance.
In a first step, the border was only lowered for customers of the postal service subsidiary Postbank - to EUR 50,000 for current accounts and investment accounts, and EUR 25,000 for day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower free allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank was previously already down to a limit of €50,000, which still applies, as does the limit at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the free allowance in two stages, first to €50,000 and now to €25,000.
Nevertheless: According to figures from the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now offer a free allowance of €25,000 or less.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also reached the limit of €25,000: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, who have won in the first instance at the Berlin District Court against this regulation.
Now the banks are discussing whether the institutions should possibly make provisions – in the event that even the highest authorities declare the negative interest rates to be unlawful and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.
The tabletop for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people.
The base is that for six people.
Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army at her disposal
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a rollercoaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, the success of 2021, which included the Friends reunion and the continuation of her series The Morning Show, is first and foremost the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers are devoted to her appearance.
Still, Aniston says, she treats herself to a chip a day (yes, really: a single chip out of the bag).
That she has the hearts of female and male fans alike is actually a wonder.
Perhaps because she's just been unlucky in love - and still searching for the big love.
And removed the baby wish from the list.
Until now she has been constantly asked when she will become a mother.
That hurt her.
People asking, they don't know what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It is to be hoped that success and fame make people happy.
Unworthy end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's retirement from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn peels off his gloves and wipes sweat from his brow.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight brush with the wall, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo after just half the race distance at the Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and final grand prix, the "Iceman" ending his career at the top level of motorsport.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates for the farewell.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and came 103 times on the podium.
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sport
The Norwegian biathlete, Ole Einar Björndalen, who has 94 wins, is the target for the bob pilot.
I've worked it out, I'd need to win nine and a half races per season, and then I could make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
On Saturday, he managed to fend off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, moving up from third to first.
He then changed something on the setup and went out on Sunday with a 0.30-second lead.
With his team, Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Briton Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian, Benjamin Maier.
We took a bigger risk today and it paid off, said Friedrich, who also stretched his winning run to 22 matches in a row.
Berchtesgaden's Johannes Lochner, who rides for Stuttgart, came in fifth after taking second place previously.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after coming in fourth in the first race.
If I knew what else he did, I would do it too, Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte took third place in the women's two-man bob on her home track.
After coming in fourth the day before in the monobob, she stormed to victory on Sunday as part of the German trio with Anschieberin Deborah Levi to win the World Cup.
The Olympic champion in the two-woman bob, Mariama Jamanka of the BRC Thüringen, came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to qualifying for the Olympics, she recorded her first podium finish of the winter.
Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki took third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool to get my first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is coming with me.
I'm really happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It is not just about pushing, but there is a lot to do around it".
Jamanka was a little irritated by the not quite perfect runs, but said: "We're heading in the right direction".
I had the ceiling in my shopping basket and could now buy it!!!
What should I do?
I haven't received it yet, that's why I haven't been able to cash it, that's why I finally asked.
Last year, because of Corona, I had other problems and never had the time.
And now it was said that he had left, which really annoyed me.
Looking at the chat, it was about the Asare seat.
I want to return it and then reorder because it's on sale :)
Why will the despatch not start until 16th March?
Nothing about long delivery times on your website
No, not until I press enter comes a field with the message
Signed off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is that a problem today
I have also sent you pictures of the wrong groceries.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one.
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello lovely sweet girls and women,
I've got a lot to say that I just want to write down, and maybe it will help others too...
I'm 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and mummy to a dog - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (together for 6J) is ill, he got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I went to see him because I have emotional needs and I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a cast due to burns).
He is also very cold and we see each other less (1-2 times a week) which is making it very difficult for me to meet my needs for affection and love.
My dog is suffering from stomach ache, I have cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I have used the heater and petted him.
I'm living with my sister and our mother, and she's away for a month.
Now we also have to do the housework, which we of course split up between us.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS is doing very well at the moment, I am doing very well in therapy and I am getting by.
Not great, but I'm managing and am almost symptom free.
My uni is asking for a lot right now (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I have a written test that I haven't done anything for and the day after tomorrow I have anatomy lecture that I should at least prepare a bit for.
And next week, on Tuesday, I have an oral exam, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no space left in my head.
So goes my week: Just until tomorrow morning, then it's the weekend.
But then what?
Only until his birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental cues because otherwise I'd just pack it in.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do otherwise...
How about you?
To be honest, I am extremely grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't even begin to express how grateful I am.
I don't know whether I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that has a lot to do with women's mental load and that's why I thought I'd find some kindred spirits here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening anyway, the week is almost over!
I got my order today, unfortunately, the whole other color, plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has an imprint.
The first delivery was the same colour as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we are going to switch tables now, will I get other colours or what?
The cancellation email was sent on #DATE#.
Other than that, twice.
However, this was not confirmed.
It was completely different: I discovered at school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and it was just another subject for them, like maths or geography.
For me it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was brought up as a Christian and I always believed in some way.
How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
I fundamentally understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a syllabus, etc.
But it would seem strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Maintaining culture or something like that?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?
That is a very long time, then I would give up
That's good, thank you.
I look forward to receiving a response in due course, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Help me find a movie
Hello lovely people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for teenagers.
There are two time axes (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure).
Since I cannot describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (in uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, their paths cross and something happens.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can survive.
I think the transition is also the soldier's final resting place.
In the end, I think both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that's what you need to say, I'm grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on their stomach from week one.
Fast forward: still alive :)
Relax.
A child can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no cuddly animals, sometimes go in and look, but no minute by minute monitoring.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
And ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child sleeping.
Turns its head to the side?
Can it stand up straight from the inside?
Or is it lying face down on the mattress?
From this you can derive whether everything is in order.
We've all grown up and when my husband was born it was all hands on deck to get the kids to sleep on your stomach.
In addition, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already bought a lot of articles.
But why are you offering me 20 euros?
Hello, I have already written to one of your colleagues yesterday and have yet to receive a response.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cupboard.
I beg you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is currently not in use.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has a lot to offer.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply the case that the politics of this station are now beneath contempt.
Every format is sponsored (ok), but then still go on a big begging tour.
It was said that it was an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote from Arno: "You don't want to be a running gag."
What are you now?
A 0815 advertiser trying to sell his Billomerc to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's dos and don'ts.
The of course apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
They can of course continue to insult people.
One Krogman is completely lacking in empathy and, at the expense of the action with the exploded rented premises, attempts to make a name for himself.
How do you find all that good?
If it makes you happy, I find it horrible.
I would like to return something, as my delivered wooden table is defective.
Break due to damaged delivery from #PRS_ORG.
Whether as a source of comfort for stomach ache or simply for cuddling - my little heat source is versatile.
Kirschkern cushions are a traditional home remedy for soothing painful conditions, as cherries are able to absorb and release heat very well.
The detachable inner cushion can be easily warmed up in the microwave or oven.
The soft connection makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel at home, even when things aren't going so well for them.
The cherry kernel cushion with reference is suitable exclusively for the following applications:
Check for unusual smells, stains or burn marks before heating the kettle and dispose of it immediately if any are found.
Please remove the inner cushion before heating!
In the microwave at maximum 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (observe the manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, the heat is evenly distributed in the cushion by shaking!
Next, lower the seatback.
With the first heating, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Absolutely stick to the given heating instructions, as longer periods or higher energy levels can cause damage (risk of ignition and burning!).
Check the manufacturer's instructions before warming up your kisses in the microwave to make sure that heating of cereal products is allowed.
After the heated inner cushion has been repositioned, please check the temperature of the cushion on your forearm to ensure it is suitable for babies (max. 43°C)!
Do not use the cushion for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulation problems, fresh haematomas, bleeding and open wounds, and for people with reduced pain sensitivity.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour conditions, or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before using.
If seams have opened and loose kernels have come out, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and inaccessibly for children.
If the product is applied to babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be regularly checked during use to avoid overheating!
Any serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authorities in the country where the user is based.
The connection is detachable and can be washed at 30°C in the machine.
Please observe the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after first half - Pauli win in Dusseldorf
Darmstadt 98 are allowed to dream of a return to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 are working their way out of the relegation zone.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt either under their third coach.
Cheers in Darmstadt following the late win in the top match, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt following the failed debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) stopped charging through my network.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that the power supply alone is enough to operate.
Battery is dead and laptop will not turn on despite being plugged in.
So I took the battery out, but still nothing.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop online?
What else is broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the #PRS_ORG delivery in my room.
How do I book that?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But we don't know how high the seat is...
Travelling a lot and still carrying a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 backpack from Peak Design!
The 20-litre capacity can also accommodate larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stowed using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And anything else you need for everyday use is kept well organised and separable from the photographic equipment, thanks to the practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design speaks for itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while granting instant access to photo gear in seconds.
There are two ways this works: conventionally through the top flap, which can be secured with the MagLatch closure system, a well thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in messenger bags.
In the closing lid there is a metal latch with appropriate anchor beams on the front of the rucksack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has come up with several "fill levels": there are four anchor points, sturdily riveted, into which the locking mechanism can be inserted.
If the rucksack is full, take the top bar; if it's empty, take a lower one.
The flaps and hooks are also magnetic.
This means that the rucksack can be closed reliably without having to insert the hook.
The second feature makes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally different from other photo backpacks: in addition to the flap, there is also a tear-off opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you don't have to rummage through the contents any more!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday practicality of the rucksack: If, for example, you are not only taking your photographic equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
With the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the inner space individually (more about this below), so that you can separate them from each other without any problems, and also access them independently through the two side openings.
This means you can also pull the rucksack from the right-hand side, so you can access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while keeping everyday items safe in the left rucksack half and not getting in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying handles help with that.
And because the outer shell of the rucksack is also completely made from 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents stay dry even when heading to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commission
Contact has been made by the shipping company to arrange collection of the wrongly delivered table.
Up until now, I have not received any news.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I am now writing with my third support worker, with no one going any further than to promise me an email as confirmation.
It's about returning the wrongly delivered Custom #NAME#
So, when could the cupboard be returned?
It is not an option for me to keep it...
It works.
Thank you very much for your help
Wishing you a lovely evening
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12/1/21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend my voucher, I will place a larger order immediately, but nevertheless I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and not sent it back.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not have imagined and have not been able to deal with it in a timely manner and clarify it.
But as a customer I have suffered damage and I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of dynamic riders, providing reliability and safety in braking, even in difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are cast and then mechanically machined (bored and cut).
All the tinted glasses are made in short series according to individual technical properties, which are specific to certain glasses and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production programme is created, which is tailored to the inspection of the disc after the properties of the original assembly.
The dished brake discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and brake effectiveness.
Additional openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, with the notches improving the cleaning of brake discs and brake pads.

Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing rocks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flourishing towns in the state.
Claims were staked, tents went up, and saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer, seeking wealth and fame in the West.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, herd horses and build businesses.
You'll also have the chance to explore the surrounding river systems and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - it seems the other pioneers have the same idea!
You have to beat your fellow pioneers to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose their actions simultaneously, you have to manage your resources and set up a tableau, which more and more works for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to be more efficient, gain extra actions or turn the rules in your favour.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style by making fine adjustments.
Coloma plays out over the course of three years, from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma) to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California became an official state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously select a location on the board where they can perform an action.
Afterwards, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a penalty!
This deactivates half of the location - thus reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunmen.
When all the actions have been completed, the pioneers return.
The chaser moves to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This goes on until the advertiser has moved five times, so that each location is covered once and the year ends.
There's a shootout where players must defend Coloma from a bandit ambush.
When players have fed enough cowboy heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they are rewarded.
However, if they fail, they receive lower bonuses or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is settled.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I am taking the shipping method to be parcel post, with dimensions of up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.

Why Children Are Not Tyrants Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW emotional abuse, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today and I watched it immediately.
Child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and holds lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Kids Are Becoming Terrorists" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and education rights claimants are now making serious allegations against him.
Please bear with it, the film is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Parents and other caregivers must never, never, never use their power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible.
Brrr, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: States are advising on the abolition of the test obligation for those who have been vaccinated three times
The State Ministers of Health want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the test obligation for people who have been vaccinated three times.
We need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the test obligation can be waived for people who have been vaccinated three times, said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to the "Bild am Sonntag".
The removal of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically sensible, but also delivers an additional booster effect," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that "he will submit a proposal to the Ministerial Conference for Health next Tuesday".
Also I will send the lamp back
How do I deal with this best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, however I cannot see how high the seat surface is.
Can they help me further?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG.
Error: Oops, something went wrong.
Buying through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my contact details.
What is the cause of this?
What you are describing will be called *awareness* so sensory perceptions under general anaesthesia.
These occur at a frequency of around 1 in 1000.
The most common experience is hearing sounds/voices, followed by seeing images, and the least common is experiencing pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that come with a higher rate of awareness since, in order to protect the child until it is born, a very deep anaesthetic is avoided.
Previous episodes of awareness should be discussed during the pre-anaesthetic assessment.
Specific anaesthetic procedures, such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), carry a slightly increased risk.
Love all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, however u/Nitemarex did not have it per definition.
Read her comment wrong.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, 20 euros won't help us with that.
Those are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take away the broken chair.
This is not only a legal requirement, but also standard practice in eCommerce.
Please check again to see if you can at least take away the broken chair.
We sell the second chair privately.
We are also losing a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email which you have not answered.
One more question.
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room in my choice.
The shipper is company #NAME#.
I was just there.
Man told me they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG.
Is that so?
If so, I must cancel the order, as I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Am I not being called then?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies aged 97
He has made a name for himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
He later wrote a monumental history of theatre.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh off the press: "An old man gets older".
The moving diary of a slow goodbye to the world that the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading it comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "Here I am already bearing witness to my life's thanks".
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common is the Euro pallet, standardised wooden pallets that are used as load carriers primarily in the European region.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from the Austrian Statistical Office, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The value of production was a good 79 million Euro.
How many palettes are imported into Austria annually will not be charged
New York Wins First MLS Championship
New York City FC have won the MLS title for the first time.
After the 1-1 draw in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the Eastern Conference team won the final in a shootout 4-2.
In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had beaten Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen tips and tricks
I got a lot of great tips last week for the perfect goulash.
We had it at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thank you again for that :)
Now I've got a taste for it, and I want to cook a roulade for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will start a beef fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, I have a large pot.
What's next?
What happened to the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I get by
IEs refers to a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was informed via email on 18th January that the refund had been processed.
Yet to this day the money has never reached me.
Please check that.
Where to get Christmas bratwurst in the region of Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and presents.
Still no poultry?
Time is running out now.
We tell you where you can still get a Christmas sausage in the room of Lübeck.
The "drive" of a valve pre-amp stage plays a significant part in the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-controls you can set the desired level and the clipping of your sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers in the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, with which the sound level can be reduced without altering the gain or the distortion.
Further up, it was already mentioned that the POWER LEVEL control can even be used to call up a reserve of performance if it gets too loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line out.
The signal lying here is processed with a boxing simulation, so that even when using headphones or direct recordings, you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression.
It can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can jam to your favourite tunes.
There is also a tuner function on board – so you don't need a separate pitch pipe.
If you've also treated yourself to a VFS5 foot pedal, you can also call up the sounds conveniently using your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off, and tap the tempo of compatible effects.
This is actually essential for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But that was the case with others.
Do you then have the opportunity to send the torch back to me?
Because it is too low for over a dinner table?
So I would love to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the wardrobe?
Will we get another update in the next few weeks regarding the exact delivery date?
Hello, are they already sitting on the #PRS_ORG# seats
If it doesn't work, I'd be happy with a refund or voucher.
Perhaps I will find a buyer for the furniture.
If I don't need the goods for more than 1,000 euros, then they are quite expensive.
I just received my shipment and would have liked to know if screws were included in the shipment.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hinges.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it

Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
According to Iranian sources, progress has been made in the negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are close to reaching an agreement on the topics to be discussed on the agenda, Iran's top negotiator Ali Bagheri told state news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because at the beginning there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The deal is meant to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a nearly week-long break.
Iranian, German, British, Chinese, French and Russian negotiators are taking part in the talks.
A U.S. delegation is in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen overtakes Saxony - Federal State now has the highest Corona incidence
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have exceeded 1000 cases on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value at 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had been the state with the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
The incidence in Thuringia had dropped slightly on Friday and Saturday, but was still above 1000.
In Thüringen, 2,242 new cases of the Sars-CoV-2 virus were reported within a day, along with 16 additional deaths linked to an infection.
200 Seriously Ill with Covid-19 Received Intensive Medical Care in Hospitals on Sunday
There can be registration delays over the weekend.
In addition, the health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is not expected until the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it, put it in an envelope and take it to the post office, right?
Do I have to do anything else here?
That is exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I'd be happy to send it back on my own dime.
A 8-euro return fee is an outrage in my eyes.
It's time for change
Greetings from the German Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the Plenary Hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the post doing here?
If you look at the activities of the German Bundestag over the past few months, one thing becomes clear: they don't exist.
We've been in a winter slump and have stretched out the summer hole for a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, where did that come from?
For the most part, this is simply down to dissatisfaction with how some things have turned out and how we are generally feeling.
In the last few days there has been a growing sense that many here are genuinely looking forward to the CDU party conference.
#What we must change
At this point, the community around the federal party conference is asking who wants to keep this alive.
The backlash came from u/edizVEVO, who recently became aware of the project and found a literal pile of rubble.
After a lot of back and forth, several members of the community have stepped forward to help rebuild the project.
However, I would like to once again appeal to everyone to get involved, so that this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have set up a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange information with each other and work on concrete things.
You can join the server by following this link.
Objectives:
How should the Bundestag work in the future?
Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves externally in the future?
How are new members going to be recruited?
How do we achieve a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot some things, but it's not a big deal, we have Discord for that.
If you have the time and inclination, come join us on Discord, work with us, and let's democratically decide the future together.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you, which is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/chunky for my taste.
I have already ordered another bracket from you.
I put it together and noticed it when I took the whipped cream.
Very sad about that.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: is the #PRS_ORG# header also available in large size, for example 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty wardrobe is removed promptly.
And I urge you to do so now.
I don't have a suitable container, but I will do my best to dismantle the wardrobe for collection - they will need to work out with #PRS_ORG how this will work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by telephone to arrange a collection date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would I have time to sort this out or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question of why you're vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like a lot.
She herself has lived as a vegetarian for a while, and doesn't eat meat very often at the moment.
I was a vegetarian for a few years myself.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned stepping stone, I answered honestly without much thought.
And that is that I thought for a long time that by being a vegetarian I was supporting animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that by doing so I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
So my decision to go vegan.
In that moment I got the impression that she was upset, she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that vegetarians reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my response was too "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan you get put in a corner and conflicts arise that you wouldn't have otherwise.
A vegan who loves harmony greets you.
It is clear that this is not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Their #PRS_ORG# does not exempt them from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I won't be collecting my return on the specified date, #PRS_ORG.
Due to a funeral, I can't be there in person, unfortunately.
Can you please assign me an alternative delivery date.
From 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available again.
Lahnsteiner wehr for water rescue prepared: €45,000 grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant of €45,000 in the Lahnstein Town Hall to Mayor Peter Labonte for the new water rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to €135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am delighted that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's lord mayor Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water they carry out tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, permanent growth in turnover is expected: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, are contributing to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following her recommendations, synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING has worked.
I'm a little frustrated because this whole thing has taken me a lot of time and now I'm hoping for help.
Okay, then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# in June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously mentioned values were measured in the Fenix Laboratory at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity, and the installed 275mAh LiPo battery.
The values can vary depending on the used torch, age and environment.
The burning time in stage Hell contains the burning time with reduced brightness due to overheating protection.

Thank you first of all for putting yourself through the whole thing, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, that of a bodyguard in the executive, furthermore I don't want to go into that any more!
I find the question of right and left always very simplistically posed.
In principle, however, one should say that of course state officials come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, should be clear to everyone that these people, dressed in their special uniforms and carrying weapons, should be able to cope with the realities of life is, of course, also clear, because you have, of course, apart from the average white person, many people with migrant backgrounds, women and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the overly feminine stereotypical queens, because these exist more in the executive than they do in normal men and women who don't feel the need to tell you about it), and these people I can and must rely on, because in case of doubt they will save your life or put themselves in danger for you.
However, even these fringe groups hold conservative views, according to my experience, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel more disadvantaged by excessive left-wing policies, even if these policies are meant to help them, they simply want to be treated normally.
Going back to the right, because of course the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but they are allowed to say their opinions openly or even formulate state-threatening plans openly in the media, which is totally exaggerated and annoys me.
Of course, it is not uncommon for even police officers and soldiers, who have often been on foreign missions, to start generalizing and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It is also not uncommon for right-wing sympathizers to meet up and engage in lively discussions.
Nevertheless, such things are well fought against in my opinion and countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationalized that it is good in my opinion that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand is that I have also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, the other #PRS_ORG# tray for #NUMBER# euros in black could still be delivered to Germany, or this tray is available somewhere in Germany.
I only see you as a partner company.
but there are two deep grooves at the top of the wooden part, which are filled with something yellow.
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
Orderly through child?
Hello, I (w32) have been bothered by one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed and have very little free time), but for as long as I can remember, I have struggled to keep my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases when nothing works, and then sometimes it gets me and I pack up and clean.
But it is actually never the case that "someone could just drop by spontaneously".
My husband (unfortunately) is not better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the budget just loses against work and disinterest.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to make your children more orderly?
We haven't done one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me, I don't have any incentive, it just doesn't bother me, as long as there's no visitors coming and there's always fresh clothes there and the kitchen is usable.
Do you give your child a bigger incentive or do you stay sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder?
I have done a software development course and have been working for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, for which reason I have been considering starting afresh and studying social work for some time now.
The problem: I have an anxious (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
In a nutshell, that means I have no self-worth and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but it's very difficult for me to carry casual conversations and I've been told many times that I come across as unapproachable (which I think I'm better at now).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family support.
However, I do not know whether the actual working day is really as I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find something on the internet about this.
The ÄVPS already leads to problems (for me, emotionally) in my job, because it brings me down every time there is something to criticise in my code ("again, just the most basic things go wrong") and it is hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know by now how to do this"/"I ask stupid questions at work"/"he must really have to put up with me" etc.).
I will probably have problems in any job but I just wanted to mention it.
However, have you already got the sofa back?
There was no confirmation of this.
I was waiting for a delivery
What do they mean by 'return' please !
When I download a book from #PRS_ORG, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# is not authorized to download this book.
are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG and they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein ingested with the food is broken down in the bird's digestive system into individual amino acid building blocks, which the bird then reassembles into its own body protein, which it also needs for feather formation.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the re-growth of feathers in the maturing bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high level of demand for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can cause disruptions to the reproductive cycle.
Following this regular dose of NEKTON-Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml water or 100 g soft feed.
It is only necessary to prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird will consume in a day and to change the water/food daily.
A measuring spoon (inset) is equivalent to 1 g NEKTON Bio.
In cases of severe feather damage, a double or triple dose of Nekton Bio can be given at the beginning, until the new feather growth becomes visible.
Afterwards, the normal dose is given until the new feather formation is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without direct sunlight, at temperatures between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break down after 9 months?
The warranty period in Germany is 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement by a church worker in contradiction to the rules
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree will be felled on our property.
So an appeal was made to the municipality.
An employee writes me that pruning fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the ordinance.
However, in the by-laws, the walnut is explicitly listed as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on expert opinions.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for them.
I have not received any message
Well, then I have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me an inheritance or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think so, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Serious road accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the exit from Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
According to a press release from the police (14:03), a car came into oncoming traffic while being overhauled.
There are casualties.
Okay, I understand.
Great, thanks again for making it so easy!
Counselling and ideas for further career
Happy Christmas to you!
My Christmas is moderately good, unfortunately, because my dear head is just thinking about everything it can think about.
Before I dive into this now, in a nutshell: I need advice and the best from people who know my situation - that's you.
I'm doing the ref as a cross over.
I originally studied something else and worked in a different field there (for the sake of anonymity, I will not mention anything more specific).
However, the whole thing was too boring for me and I started looking for alternatives that might be more fun.
At some point I landed in teaching and I was sure that's what I wanted to do - even though the working conditions are a lot less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I'm now on my third "I google other job postings"
And it's only half a year away.
In the past, I have always decided to carry on and at least finish the ref, after which I can still change my mind.
Yet I am absolutely exhausted.
I had so little free time last month that I'm completely exhausted.
There are holidays now, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the game I thought I was stress-resistant, but that weekend was my weekend and my celebration time was my celebration time.
That was my time.
And the stress of work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now, the holidays are too much stress for me.
And then there are these stiff structures, which annoy me even more.
Basically it's fun and from an outsider's perspective the ref is going well, which is good for feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I wonder if I want to carry on like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts - or whether I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, where I was given time off when I needed it, where the work was tedious but I was adequately paid for it and where I worked as part of a team and not as an individual like it is now most of the time.
But then I ask myself whether I will be in the same place next year, and whether I will be dissatisfied.
You know, it's all kind of a blur, but maybe as an outsider you have some advice or ideas for how I might extricate myself from this situation, in which I am completely over it and basically start crying at the thought of it.
I'm not making any decisions right now, that's probably not a good thing.
But maybe your opinions will help me see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me right now.
Thank you for reading and excuse my whining tone.
I hope my situation is at least a little clearer now.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modelling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behaviour of a valve amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are presenting a brand new modelling engine, which is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely stunning.
These amps, of course, feature the multi-stage Valvetronix tube pre-amplifier.
This partly relies on actual analogue circuits because they get the sound variations and nuances of a valve amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated arrangement, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed casing and a bass reflex system, from which natural resonances only emerge.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, until the amp and the effects sound the way you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology, which was first introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times in order to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 once again led to an increase in performance for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a valve amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that it was the final stage that determined the tube characteristic of the amplifier and, based on this finding, developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ power amplifier, fitted with a 12AX7 tube, forms the behaviour, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a valve amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic fell 106-104 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro fastening sections, it can be adapted to suit the needs of your photographic equipment, and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes right up to full-format reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits into the backpack will depend on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible stocking filler could be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two or three additional lenses and a pop-up flash.
Larger DSLM cameras, such as the various models in the Sony a7 series or the Fuji X-T2, allow for additional lenses.
In addition, a lot of accessories can be stowed away.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for things that are not related to photography.
Drone pilots will also find the Everyday Backpack 20L to be an optimal choice as it offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro, including the remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest known in the history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Up until now, the 84-day eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in the past few days, but volcanologists are not yet prepared to speculate on when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to state TV channel RTVE.
Millions in damage
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1,000 degrees Celsius hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1700 football pitches.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, with damage estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landmasses, measuring around 50 hectares in total, have emerged from the coast due to the solidification of lava.
The banana industry, which is of vital importance to the island, was particularly hard hit, with around half of the island's 85,000 population either directly or indirectly depending on it, and it was already in crisis before the volcano erupted.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, with further areas severely affected, wrote newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree are connected to the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension something tempting.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still brings our increasingly divided society together.
It is even more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", can be freed from the strict routine and filled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christ Child
Technically, it was the Protestants who made Christmas so closely associated with drinking.
In the past, on St. Nicholas Day, gifts were given to one or two people.
The background to this still popular custom is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw gold through the window of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
This unconventional act of giving birthed the popular German tradition of filling children's shoes with gifts.
Protestants objected to this practice because they rejected the idea of intermediaries between God and humans as "idolatry."
For these reasons, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas into the Christ-child and thereby founded a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, as most Protestants no longer take such detail questions so seriously, it only annoys a few that the custom of St. Nicholas is still as firmly entrenched in the pre-Christmas period, with St. Nicholas songs and the St. Nicholas procession.
Today, you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches by the door and under the Christmas tree.
Variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources document a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was postponed to Christmas Eve.
However, in all the Christian countries there is a joyful hubbub about the question of who now brings the children their presents.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is essentially a kind of Nikolaus, to whom some characteristics have been ascribed over time.
These include his long white beard, which has little in common with the more severe Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the heating chamber to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas time.
In Spain, it is the Three Kings who bring the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch, Befana, who is supposed to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures deliver gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought fame to some.
It's not reindeer, but three horses pulling a sleigh known as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near palace
A gunman has been shot by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said the caller reported a man with a gun had entered a bank and a bookmaker's business.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle, which was subsequently stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Police are not treating it as a terrorist incident.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Kate and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The light is simply mounted and can be anchored with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and high-performance 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum duration of light 10 hours
The robust plastic casing can be used outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood blockbusters, they are usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow with inner colour.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar lantern glows fascinatingly - either in white or coloured light (in six different colour tones).
The borderless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit in with any natural environment – whether on the terrace, in the lawn or in the flower bed.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and cobbles, where he is able to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save a lot of work: As a solar lantern, "Smart Stone" requires neither an electrical connection nor batteries.
Place the "glow stone" in any sunny spot of your choice.
Two ground spikes, which are included, provide additional stability if required.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, along with his battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the case.
As dusk begins to set in, "Smart Stone" starts to glow by itself; in what colour, you decide for yourself: You have six attractive light colours to choose from – in addition to daylight white.
The switching off also happens automatically as soon as the battery charging stand has dropped to a predetermined minimum or it gets light again.
Once the sun starts shining again, the charging cycle will begin again the next day.
I've done that several times and it doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello lovely ladies,
I hope I'm doing everything right, this is my first post on reddit after a year.
My problem: I was forced to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I was getting such terrible cramps during my period and PMS before my period.
Now I'd like to stay there because I have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses that I can't refuse.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I'd gone from 0 to 100 with a bang, getting spots everywhere.
As superficial as that, but it really upset me and I didn't feel well.
In the two-year hiatus, it never really normalized.
Perhaps someone somewhere has some tips on how to avoid it this time.
Scent-free and noise-free is my cosmetics already, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Gynaecologist unfortunately didn't take me seriously and dermatologist appointment is still pending.
Many thanks to everyone who has read the novel!
And the love of the skin is such a new thing.
Had terrible neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then widespread knotty eczema and the acne problem.
I have also tried every diet under the sun for my Christian illness and have remained on a sugar, milk and meat-free diet because nothing else has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormonally the worm is simply in there, but if you, like me, have a building site everywhere, you'd rather not have to search any more for what else is going on.
I had already done everything their colleague seminars, etc.
Written and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my request.
I had to keep working and talking on the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
If the money was there, I would have seen it

In the name of the people: Lay people pass judgement
In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
But much depends on their verdict, even if they don't wear robes: Jurors, along with professional judges, determine whether someone goes to jail and for how long.

110 kV underground cable to be newly built in 2022
The approval for the laying of new high-voltage cables at Tann is legally binding.
The planning decision by the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for construction, which is set to begin in 2022.
This was announced by the network operator, Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometre long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the town and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected near the village of Edermanning, near Reut, to a pylon of the overhead line.
Good morning.
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue Betsell number: #PRS_ORG# with the invoice number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible".
All three of the other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next steps are?
A great start to the week!
You can forget that, I have already explained that more than once yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and all the sides have collapsed so it's just glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The wardrobe is in my home and #PRS_ORG# will not come into my home because of the #PRS_ORG# rules
This means that the wardrobe cannot be collected because no one is allowed in my home
Thank you for the message
but why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it's with all books, that's why the request was made to #PRS_ORG, as it must be a general problem.
Subject: Lesson Planning (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been on study leave since the summer, teaching is fun, but at the moment I'm struggling to plan my lessons in geography in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well-equipped, so in principle I can only use the blackboard, textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school I can only copy for free in black and white (which is annoying for geography).
At the moment I just need a long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently talking about geographic factors, and for me, every hour is different.
In principle, the methods are always repeating themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (I need that time for other things as well).
I actually plan from the learning goal out (what do I want to achieve) and work back from there (often I'll create a worksheet of texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore, the work sheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
Would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one with #PRS_ORG# although I would like to get rid of the return flights as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G rule for Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or have recovered are allowed.
The trade considers this to be unnecessary and complains about a drop in turnover.
He also has a possible solution at the ready.
From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations deprive retailers of the important Christmas business.
Stefan Genth, HDE's managing director, criticised a drop in sales at shops selling non-essential items.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off their Christmas business.
What should have been the high point of the year is now often a hole with no bottom, said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only running well in the food wholesale sector and online.
The association called for consequences to be drawn from the dramatic development.
The purchase with masks, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
Buying 2G is not going to help us in the fight against the pandemic, he stressed.
The current rules scare customers and require a lot of staff.
The loophole must be closed nationwide, he demanded.
Afterwards, each customer would only need to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores that day with the received wristband.
In addition, in retail – as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) – spot checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also reported a difficult Christmas.
Frequencies were last at around 75 percent of pre-Corona levels without 2G, with sales at around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall right in the middle of the important Christmas business," said managing director Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Because of the high personal and administrative costs, centres are trying to find solutions and get them approved.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, with which "visitors, for example, can produce their 2G proof at a central point in the centre, and then, equipped with a wristband similar to those used in club hotels, can enter all shops unimpeded".
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#
The mirror has a scratch and the frame also has a fault, which has been attempted to be covered with a yellow filler.
It looks bad.
I would love to give the mirror back and have already put it back in the box and taped it up.
What do I need to do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is responsible for setting the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
Besides adjusting the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and tungsten.
It is also possible to manually set and save the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simply and intuitively usable.
The light emits a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The 120-degree field of view at which you can observe large areas at relatively close distances is excellent.
In addition, in situations with reporters in small rooms or short intervals.
They can adjust the brightness practically without changing the colour temperature.
It's a great tool to use on set or in post-production.
The optional DMX512 controller allows the light to be remotely controlled in television studios or if the light is mounted in hard to reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in per cent and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
In addition, there is a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
To save the settings of the individual settings to the storage locations, it is simply marked by pressing one of the storage keys for longer, and finished.
The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, if the camera is set to specific colour temperatures.
Working with battery is one of the biggest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, resulting from the possibility of working with low-cost NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check the batteries before setting up, to see if they have enough power - it is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments, there is a value shown in the two displays (the left upper display for the left battery, the right lower display for the right battery).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlights with power via the supplied network cable.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They come with a 16mm threaded mount so you can attach them directly to your tripod.
The inclination can be accurately set using levelers on both sides.
It was noted that the mechanical components are of extreme high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and heavy use.
In addition, a swivel is included in the delivery.
What's great is that the delivery also includes a bag.
This means that you can transport or store the spotlight and all its accessories without any problems.
Sadly I got given this and it's too small :(
Team we wanted to throw a party for: Frankfurt celebrate after torrid comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessen, who had not won in their last two matches in a row, thought they were on the way to their next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned it around, got rid of the frustration of a poor start to the season within a good hour, and won 5:2. "It's insane what the boys have achieved today," exclaimed coach Oliver Glasner on DAZN, and praised every single one of them with a "blanket compliment".
However, at first glance, it looked like a brake for the now ninth-place Frankfurt team, who are still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led Leverkusen 2:0.
What happened next also impressed the SGE coach.
How the players then came back and produced a fantastic performance, said Glasner.
I'm absolutely delighted with the performance we've shown and, of course, the result as well.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the pitch for the first time since the fourth match and his muscle injury, also stressed the morale of his teammates.
I think our mentality is unbelievable," said the 27-year-old, looking ahead to the result with particular satisfaction for the spectators.
This was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, for the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus, but he also feels well set up in terms of personnel.
It's unusual that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are in top physical shape.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players live highly professional lives.
Now they want to "continue step by step and remain humble" and complete the tasks by the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (8.30 p.m., Sky).
I received an email that my package was returned to you because of a mistake on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and having it redirected, no luck.
Can it be resent directly to me or do I have to wait for the money to be refunded and then reorder?
Unfortunately for me that would mean that I would not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Are they already sitting on the #PRS_ORG# seats?
Brake for handball women before quarter-final against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court after their humiliation against Denmark with their heads hanging and their eyes empty.
At the end of the World Championship main round, the DHB team suffered a crushing defeat, 16:32 (8:13), in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarter-finals.
We were far too nervous and had too much respect for the opposition, said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was by far the worst game we've had to flush away," said captain Emily Bölk.
A fight for a semi-final place against the 2019 World Championship runners-up next Tuesday must see a significant improvement to keep the dream of a first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was goalkeeper Alina Grijseels, who scored six goals.
We weren't there - either in attack or defence, said right-back Xenia Smits, and called for: "We have to look forward quickly now".
Not up to par from front to back
Unlike in the previous five matches, the German team did not get off to a flying start.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defence were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at the right temperature and prevented worse with some parries.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a fast counter-attack.
This was not the hoped-for initial spark, however.
Against the aggressive marking of the Danish women, the German women could hardly get into the game - and when they did, they usually failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
So the match ended 3:10 after 20 minutes, with goalkeeper Mia Zschocke seeing red for a hard foul on her opponent just a few minutes later.
In the quarter-finals, however, she will be able to play again.
It wasn't until the final stages of the first half that the DHB team started to come into the game, and by the break at least they had managed five goals.
The faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone seven minutes into the 9:19.
Once again, the Greens' proteges sinned in all areas and made it easy for their well-prepared opponent, who is a candidate for a medal at the final.
As a result, the German team could no longer muster an improvement in performance and went onto the floor as clear losers.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions at Christmas time
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we got St. Nicholas Day and we're using that as an excuse to talk about holiday traditions in the pre-Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

Do they do that?
The title exists, I work as an infectious disease doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (to date) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, among others, is being administered in nursing homes.
As these are almost all finished now, it goes on to the vaccination centres for me.
I enjoy answering questions about organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, without a time limit, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, will this affect my vaccination?").
Tasks within my remit include clarifying vaccination, determining indications (person has entitlement to vaccination according to the Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance and no reasons against this), medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in the event of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In immunization teams, however, we often don't have immunization assistants, but "only" pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of vaccines, who, however, cannot administer injections (can they?), so I have to do most of the injections myself there.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, there was plenty of food for thought in the Bavarian regional television programme "Wir in Bayern".
However, unlike on many previous days, the term "Host mi?" was left unanswered by callers in the series.
No, it wasn't "some guy who was nervous".
And no one, "who has to do everything quickly".
That, according to the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
This is what the man from Amberg had to say about the solution, and thereby probably caused surprise among many Upper Palatinate people.
The "Huidlerer" is a rag that someone uses to clean the oven, viewers were told.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted for years by Bavarian television as an expert, confirmed that.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate concept, derived in some way from the better-known dialect word "Houdern".
With which a gap in education was closed - probably also for many who have lived in Amberg for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
It follows a confirmation message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have #PRS_ORG# up and running again, connected to the PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing has helped.
Tyre selection for racing bikes - really that reliable?
This morning I woke up with a sense of urgency because I wanted to train for my upcoming bike tour at least a little bit before the week.
Said, done and I went for a ride on my racing bike that I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really beautiful – but then that happened, which lurks in every city centre (thank you, Krefeld!).
Shards of glass on the line.
Zack, squeaky brakes and my rear tyre definitely didn't want to do any more of the journey.
As I had no realistic chance of getting a replacement jacket and hose due to the day of the week, I had to make do with half-heartedly turning around and taking the first train home.
So it's not such a bad thing that the war is not going so well, maybe it's better that I practice changing the tires again before the bike trip.
However, now I have a question and hope that you can help me.
As I have a relatively long stretch of several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem again.
It wasn't really bad now, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who had ridden 120km by the time I picked up the bicycle at 2:00 p.m. on the day I went to collect it!) had also described as suboptimal because he had ridden them for years on the road.
But if I think about having to change a tire after driving 80-90km, then I'm really in a bad mood:D
Now I was talking to an older man at the platform and he asked me why I didn't have the marathon plus tyres; these are supposed to be unplatable.
Now, of course, it all sounds very tempting.
But are they really that indestructible?
I'm not really in the mood now to spend €40/tyre just to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I ask myself: at the moment, on my racing bike, I believe I have 25 x 622.
There are indeed (apparently?) also wider marathon plus tyres, but the majority are already wider.
Is that a problem?
Or would you generally recommend a different brand of bicycle tire to me?
The swallow page seems to be my absolute! Rather recommend the Durano DD to you?
Thank you in advance for your help and best wishes!
Car crashes into tree: Driver killed
The 53-year-old was travelling on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten in his car for an unknown reason when he collided with a central reservation and ended up in the wrong lane, according to police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The man's car was then rammed into a tree and he was trapped inside.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to local hospitals.

Following the publication of our new high-end broadband cable B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series started to produce offspring once again.
SOLO 15 is the new offspring, and it looks like the big models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this building proposal, a suitably designed foot is included to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adapted to the conditions at home in terms of length.
Principally, the SOLO 15 is very well suited to people for whom the maximum volume is less of a priority, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high level of sound quality.
A 10cm speaker simply isn't capable of generating near-unfiltered such high sound pressure levels.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it is remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was the SOLO 15 with a slight high-end lift.
This is common practice with broadband to optimise the increasing bundling of high frequencies.
The SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound, which is precisely tailored to the listening position.
The treble range can be tilted slightly outwards, thus reducing the treble range and warming up the sound.
Thanks to the point source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is pinpoint accurate.
The reference-suspect extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure that it has the same enemy.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kit builds, it's a good idea to think about the final cosmetic appearance of the speakers at the outset, so that any necessary changes can be incorporated into the build.
For example, if you want to veneer the case, the drop in the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds more material.
After all the boards had been cut to size (e.g. in the DIY store), the first thing to do was to drill a 8mm hole in the floor board in the appropriate place, so that the cables could be fed through there later without any problems.
With the help of a jib crane, the speaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used later.
At the back, this opening should be rounded off with a 45° phase so as to make the opening of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw connection points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are interrupted in the phase shown in the "Detail Phase" image.
Afterwards, the actual construction of the box begins, with one of the two side walls being placed on a flat surface in front of you.
These are now glued onto the back, lid, front and base.
The three reinforcements should also be used and glued in.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in thickness if required, for example, if you want to use pre-cut plywood from the DIY store instead of making your own from 16mm MDF.
In the next working step, the second page will be added.
After that, all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides and the front, follow.
Using a suitable hole saw or Forstner drill, the installation of the bass reflex port openings, as well as the mounting clip on the back, can be facilitated.
Finally, a round sander is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The upper surface of the sole plate can also be rounded off using this method.
Afterwards, the footprint is firmly glued to the bottom of the case and additionally screwed in with long wooden screws.
Next, mark and drill (2.5mm drill) the fixing points for the speaker chassis and the connector.
After the case has been cleaned of wood dust (absorb / blow off), you can begin to move the cable.
The easiest way to achieve this is through the 35mm bass reflex port in the back wall.
During this process, the entire, uncut cable is fed through the 8mm hole in the foot, one section at a time, until it reaches the terminal opening, and is left hanging out approximately 30cm.
At the top of the case, lead the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang loosely there as well.
Afterwards, the frequency switch is prepared and used.
The construction plan for the frequency changer, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be obtained from the following document: Installation manual for Weiche Solo 15.
Once the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed in, the sealing of the 8mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, follows.
Using the 35mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a bit of skill, you can pour hot glue into the opening and close it.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small torch you can check the seal accordingly.
According to the description, now follows the damping.
Next, the B 100 - 6 OHM is connected and tightened with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive lead (marked cable) must be connected to the positive terminal of the speaker (larger contact).
The bass reflex tube is then cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
To dampen vibrations, a mat of damping material is cut in two and loosely inserted into the housing.
The bass reflex port should be left open.
Can I cancel an order now and deliver at the beginning of June?
Hello everyone,
We are finally able to announce that we will once again be organizing the OSCAST this year!
For obvious reasons, we were unable to get more than four people in the studio, which has meant a higher level of planning and the need for a quick announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per shift, so we'll be live-tweeting the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans, and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - but we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start at about 00:30.
Stock up on drinks, plan a good meal and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
