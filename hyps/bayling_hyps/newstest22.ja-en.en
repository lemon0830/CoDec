I don't even want to watch TV anymore...
So what if Takahashi Rumiko became a TV personality?
When I watched Netflix's "Iroha" yesterday, there were a lot of scenes where the staff would burst into laughter behind the scenes.
"I can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of it all, even though it's not really funny."
However, if the staff don't smile, the actor's suspicion will be aroused and the work will become unbearable.
In the past, the sports world was dominated by black-owned businesses, but now it's being taken over by a bunch of egomaniacs who think they're better than everyone else.
On the other hand, there are a lot of people who say, "Oh, it's so hard to be a performer."
I understand that the income is not enough to make a living, but it seems like the job of an actor is one of the top positions.
There is no justification for the beautification of one's own career and clowns in the media and society.
It is true that the entertainment industry is a cut-throat business, but it seems that the monkeys in the entertainment industry are becoming increasingly ridiculous.

Merchandise purchased at Tsukumo Net Shop was swapped at random
Note: If you ordered a wireless mouse and received a wired mouse, you can return it for a refund
Although the topic of PCs is not as popular as it used to be, it is still a well-known topic, so I will write about it here.
It was found that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was sold at a price of 3,280 yen at the Tukemon shop that started from the previous gold week.
Since the price of the wireless version was the same as the price of the wired version at the store, I checked the price of the wired page as well, and it was 5,071 yen (link to source). Therefore, I ordered it without considering the possibility of a miss.
An order confirmation email usually arrives, followed by a shipping confirmation email the next day.
The name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" is written in the purchase history of these two emails and my page.
Because there was no communication or cancellation notice from the order until the goods were shipped, the wires were thought of at that time.
Here's the problem, about 3 hours after the order was shipped, I received an email saying "There was an error in the product registration".
According to the email,
It was sold at a discount as a wireless version, but it was actually a wired version.
Since the wireless mouse is already in stock,
1. Refuse to accept it and cancel everything.
2. Return the mouse alone for a refund
3. Use a wireless mouse.
Choose the corresponding option.
The product page for both the wired and wireless versions has been separated, and the purchase history and invoice have been marked as wireless even if the wired version was sent by mistake.
Was the product you received the same as the one you purchased? If not, please send it back without any explanation and we will issue a refund.

The only bridge out of the area due to the typhoon and heavy rain has been released. Residents have stocked up on food three times. (Fukushima Television)
Mr. Matsubara of Matsubara Town, Shirayama District, Fukushima Prefecture.
The typhoon that hit Japan in 2019 had a significant impact on the elderly.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first, it was like 'Majika'.
We were worried about what would happen if the bridge was washed away, or if it was damaged by the tsunami.
Residents whose water supply has been cut off have been using the unused JR bridge to transport necessary goods.
Mr. Matsumoto: "The cars usually come up to the court, but when they drop the cars, I carry them or push them with my back, and walk on the steel bridge to get to the other side, so I felt the inconvenience of the traffic and the hardship of the cars." The emergency bridge, which was completed one month later, became isolated for several days due to heavy rain, even though it was a provisional bridge.
It has been two years since the disaster, but Mr. Matsumoto is still continuing his lessons.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there were about 10 cases.
For the time being, we need to ensure that we have enough food for two to three days. Foods that can be used as emergency rations, such as instant noodles and canned goods, are stocked at about three times the level before the disaster.
Ms. Matsubara: "Since I don't know when the disaster will strike my own body, I thought it would be better to have some savings and be prepared for the worst." On the other hand, the town of Toshima, which experienced the "unforeseen disaster" of the bridge collapse.
Starting from 2021, the town began its own takeover in order not to forget the lessons.
Takahashi Yuichi, the head of the education department of the town of Minamisoma: "We have decided to hold the 'Minamisoma Disaster Prevention Day' on October 12th next year in the form of 'Minamisoma Disaster Prevention Day', and we will announce it."
We have been expanding, and our awareness of things that can go wrong has increased.

Building condition survey system - Yahoo! News
The newly established "Building Condition Survey" system is aimed at revitalizing the Chinese housing market.
Housing starts, along with the price of mansions, have been rising, and the renovation market has also been expanding.
On the other hand, items represented by words such as "in front of the station / near the station / direct connection" and "large-scale" and "tower" have gathered popularity, and relatively inexpensive new buildings have decreased.
【この記事の画像を見る】 しかしながら海外に比べ、日本における既存（中古）住宅流通シェアはまだまだ低い水準にとどまっている。
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) revised part of the Housing Construction Contract Law, initiated building condition surveys with the aim of introducing safe and secure middle-aged housing (https://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which builders with expertise in residential construction check the current status of the property and the condition of the building, including deterioration, and report it to prospective buyers.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explains that there are benefits for both buyers and sellers in the introduction of inspections.
Sellers can avoid contingency clauses by conducting a property inspection before listing, giving buyers peace of mind.
It is said to be due to the differentiation of competitive products.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system in which the status of the used house to be purchased can be grasped and the purchase can be made, and it is said to be a system with a large merit.
Under the current system, the main responsibility for conducting building condition surveys lies with the property owner.
In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that only the notification of the inspection system has become a duty.
In other words, real estate professionals who are responsible for brokerage will be able to introduce architects who conduct building condition surveys, or say that they cannot, but the actual implementation is not obligated.
On the other hand, if you look at the inspection of the selling principal, there is a risk to be remembered. However, if you look at the overseas market, there are already similar systems in place in active markets such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
In the preliminary stage of residential property purchase, the buyer may request a building inspection from specialists called "inspectors" or "building surveyors".
For example, in the United States, about 70-90% of the inspections are carried out based on the state's regulations.
In terms of the point where the "buyer" leads the inspection, the main Japanese inspection and its nature are significantly different from that of the "seller".
The landlord may inspect the condition of the building even if it is just a little, as long as it is possible, and try to sell it as soon as possible.
On the other hand, the prospective buyer is considering whether to purchase the property after tasting the investigation content and making the necessary repairs.
Even with the same inspection, there are differences in the purposes and thoughts of both parties.
For this reason, the Japanese system is criticized for the following points:
The scope of the inspection of the selling principal determined by the state is minimized.
Because of the lack of detailed investigation, there is a risk of overlooking truly important non-compliance. For the inspection company, the brokerage firm that introduces the case (the seller) is also a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that an inspection with a "highly critical" tone is carried out, such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to wholesalers.

Is Ginza an island?
5 things to talk about while wearing a silver blazer (LEON.JP) - Yahoo! News
This is where the island used to be.
It's not just Ginza.
Let's take a look and introduce you to the knowledge of Ginza's beans.
Up to the rooftops!
Entered the zodiac for the first time
If you walk along the Ginza, you will find places with changing names, mysterious stone monuments, many shops, and traces of the history engraved on the ground.
Walking with her in Ginza, she suddenly said, "Ah, this used to be an island half a century ago.
Is Ginza an island?
The nickname for the bustling street that gave birth to "Ginza" in various parts of Japan, and the nickname for Tokyo's "Ginza".
The term "Ginza" is derived from the silver smithing workshop, and it was moved to Edo in 1612 (Tokugawa 17th year).
At the time, it was called "Shinjuku Town," but it became known as "Silver Square" when it was moved to Tsukiji.
On the other hand, the "peninsula" protruding into the sea near Ginza was called.
Before the Edo period, the river flowed into the inner moat of Edo Castle from the Nihonbashi area, and the "Edo Peninsula" extending from Nihonbashi to Ginza was an island.
The tip of that peninsula is where the current Financial District is.
Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the bakufu in Edo and buried the moat to advance the fortification of the Kyobashi area.
Furthermore, in order to renovate the town and develop boat transportation, the moat was dredged.
Then, by cutting down the embankment and digging a moat, it was fortified.
In front of the Tiffany & Co. store in Ginza (Chuo-ku, Ginza 2-7), there is a stone monument marking the site of the former Ginza military base. If you are interested, you can try looking for it.
Knowledgeable person knows the "Holy Land Pilgrimage" of Ginza
The "Ginza Hachiman Shrine Stroll" is held every year in Ginza, which is known as the "Holy Land Pilgrimage."
Among the 10 or more sacred sites, the most eye-catching would be the "Fertility Goddess Temple" in front of the Kabuki Theater.
The seats on the right side of the orchestra will be occupied by fewer people who come to watch the performance.
On the one hand, "Ryūkōbujō" is located on the second floor of the Ginza Matsuba, while "Ginza Shōjō" is located on the 9th floor of the Ginza Terrace.
The "Children's Iris Temple" and "Azuma Iris Temple" are located in the basement of the building, but they are not open to the public, except for the "Success Iris Temple" located on the 1F of the Entrance Lounge of the Ginza Building, which is dedicated to the goddess of prosperity.
Along the path of this shrine, there are places where Amaterasu Omikami and Jizo Bosatsu are worshipped, but almost all of the shrines are dedicated to the harvest deity.
The "Strawberry Fields" in front of the imperial palace, where foxes gather, was built as a benefit for the "Five Grain Fields" where crops are abundant.
As a result of this shift, the interests of merchants flourished in cities such as Kyoto and Edo, and even in Japan's bustling streets and skyscrapers, faith has become widespread.

On the other hand, a man in his 70s was found dead in the middle of a river in the town of Fukuoka, Okawaki City.
There was no disarray in the male's attire, but there was a bicycle that had fallen nearby.

South Korean Posco International to Acquire Senegal's Enagie, Expand Overseas Gas Business - South Korean Report (WoW!Korea - Yahoo! News)
Poseidon Energy announced on the 12th that it had concluded a stock purchase agreement with Senex Energy and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy and Senex Energy acquisition.
Now that the due diligence process, including the approval of local partners, has been completed, the acquisition process is expected to be completed in March next year.

That pain in the ankle, what if it's "ankle dysplasia"?
Different treatment methods (Medical DOC) - Yahoo! News
Editing department: We've been experiencing knee pain lately.
What are the chances of getting sick?
Mr. Yamanaka: The cause of the pain in the knee joint varies, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout.
Among Japanese, the most common one is "scoliosis".
Editing Department: Is it that the joints are deforming?
Mr. Yamanaka: Yes.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which cushions the impact or smoothly moves the joint.
However, there are cases where the bones become soft or deformed due to causes such as calcium deficiency or malnutrition.
As a result, the deformation and inflammation of the joints occur.
Editorial Department: Can flexion contracture occur outside the knee?
Mr. Yamanaka: Yes.
In addition to the ankle, the joints and roots of the fingers, the neck, the waist, the thumb of the hand, and the elbow joint can be caused.
However, the most common cause is a condition called "flexible knee joint disease."
Editorial Department: So, what kind of structure does the joint have?
Mr. Yamanaka: The joint is composed of two bones that are curved together.
The part of the two bones that face each other is covered by the "cartilage" and the surrounding of the joint is covered by the "capsule".
Editing department: It's a complicated structure, isn't it?
Mr. Yamanaka: Yeah.
The inner lining of the joint capsule is called the synovial membrane, and it produces synovial fluid.
This lubricant has a role of reducing friction and is composed of hydrocarbons and sulfur compounds.
To make the movement of the knee smoothly, it is said that Hyaluronic acid and condrochondrin sulfate are good.
Editorial Department: What kind of symptoms are caused by degenerative joint disease?
Mr. Yamanaka: The cartilage has stickiness and elasticity, and serves to prevent direct contact between bones.
Well, it's a role like that of a Cushion.
However, if it is excessive or distorted, it may cause joint deformation or inflammation, resulting in pain.

"Kaiji" Series Gambling & Game 3 (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The explosively popular manga series Gintama centers around a male protagonist.
One of the alcoholic tastes in this work is the ultimate game with death.
【写真】見ているだけで足がすくむ... ... 鉄骨渡りに挑戦！
Therefore, this time, I would like to verify the game that can actually be played, or the game that has been practiced in the animation.
The trap-filled Pachinko character "Nene" appeared in "Pachinko Break".
In the original work, a high rate of 1,4000 yen per ball was charged.
This "pond" is covered with large traps of "Fang of the Forest", "Moveable Equipment", and "3-stage Culverin", making it almost impossible to approach.
In this case, Kaji used a variety of methods, such as digging a trench for a water pipe made of vinyl and placing it on the foundation of the building, to create a barrier.
The "Kaiji" character who appears in the game is actually Pachinko, and many people are playing.
Of course, it is not necessary to say things like "1 yen for 4000 yen" anymore, but it will be possible to convey the atmosphere of the old days.
The "Stars and Stripes Party," which was held to celebrate the gold medals won by the members of the Japanese team, was a "human steeplechase."
The climbers work their way up the 10-meter-tall fine steel wires, racing against each other.
Twelve people can participate, and the top two can win the prize. However, there are only four bones, and the safety measures are inadequate, so the possibility of death is quite high.
This roller coaster has a high level of danger, but in addition to being launched as a VR game, it is possible to experience the closest sensation to the real thing at the "Iguribridge" set up at the base of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles baseball stadium, "Rakuten Life Park Kokuritsu".
This Eiffel Bridge is located at a height of 20 meters (corresponding to the 7th floor of the building) and has a steel bridge extending from it. The "Sky Bridge" and "Victory Bridge" are prepared in advance at the location.
Of course, security measures are being implemented.
Corey Feldman, the comedian, posted a video of himself walking across the Brooklyn Bridge on his own YouTube channel with the title "I Crossed the Brooklyn Bridge in Japan" and caused a sensation.
■E CARD 2人対戦のカードゲーム、「E CARD」。
The emperor's card is 1, the citizen's card is 8, the slave's card is 1, and a total of 10 cards are used for the emperor and slave sides.
This game is very good, and the emperor is strong to the citizens, the citizens are strong to the slaves, and the slaves are strong to the emperor.
In the play, Kaji fights against the Tokugawa shogunate with the cruel rule of "cutting off one's own ears if defeated."
Kaiji, who was aware that the device that shattered the eardrums like the sound of gunfire was transmitting information such as pulse and body temperature changes, caused confusion in the Rhine River by reducing his own body to an abnormal value with the device.
The card is sold in stores and can be purchased at places like Amazon.
YouTube has uploaded a video of Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, playing the role of Kaiji in the movie with Fujii Ryouta and Ekard, and talked about it.
Do you want to try the Cajun spice?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kai's, but it's a fact that reading manga can make you feel better.
Through the game, try to feel the world view.
Taking a step towards the New Year, kindly donate to the Kumano Grand Shrine
In preparation for the New Year, the Shinto shrine in the city of Yamagata welcomed the grand horse of the coming year, "Tora".
On the 11th day of the month, design students from Tohoku University of Art and Design visited the same shrine and performed a ritual offering.
The shrine has been commissioning ukiyo-e woodblock prints from art students since last year.
The work of 22-year-old Yui Sasaki, who is in the 9th grade of the Art and Japanese Painting course instructed by Professor Endo, was adopted.
The giant horse is 3.3 meters wide, with a height of about 1.8 meters in the center.
Ms. Tsuchiya described the image of "cherry blossoms gently pushing behind her as she steps into the new year."
Standing still and admiring the cherry blossoms, the posture of the person looking at the cherry blossoms is one of "having enough leisure to appreciate the natural beauty even in a rapidly changing world."
The design of the tatami-matted room is depicted in many ukiyo-e prints.
Katsunori Chiba, a 44-year-old employee at Gongnegi, said, "I want to help people who are struggling."

"I want to continue living in Yamaguchi": Proposal for a workshop for high school students in the city: "Digital San Deji"
What kind of town was Yamanaka in 2030?
Students from four high schools in Yamanashi City are participating in a workshop to think about the future of "Yamanashi that we want to live in."
As part of the survey and policy proposal activities of the intermediate support organization "Yamano Sdg Miraizu Kuri Center," young people's voices are collected and presented to mayors.
What's so fun about that?
In response to the question of the Fascist, the apprentice answers with phrases such as "when many people gather together" and "when I am thirsty."
It was opened for the first time on November 13 at the NHK Hall.
The 18 high school students and people from the region talked about their respective themes while moving the "island" using the "World Café" method, and discussed the themes of "nice town", "convenient town", and "town with a livable atmosphere".
Each idea is written down in a notebook and arranged on a piece of paper.
"If there are many young people in a town, it will become lively." "There is no need to worry about transportation, such as trains and buses."
Common ground or not, let's talk more.
"I thought it was going to be muddy, but it was so exciting to be able to cycle on the beach," says Yamaguchi, a third-year student at Yamaguchi High School (18).
The 18-year-old third-year high school student from Kyushu says, "Our store is small and the traffic is inconvenient, but there are plenty of natural attractions." By talking with adults, he has become aware of the charm of the region.
The second meeting in December will be attended only by high school students, and the content of the proposal will be organized.
In February next year, the mayor and the minister of education will hold a press conference.
The Executive Director of the same center said, "If high school students can grow up with their hometown love, they will become the key to making young people active."

And so, even in such an environment, we are able to perform to the best of our abilities.
It's a bit of a long sentence in Japanese, but the gist of it is that the person is saying that they don't like it when the other person asks "What's that song?" and then starts singing a different song.
It's a great time to be Get Buck.
The English translation for this sentence is: "The scene where the lyrics gradually enter the song 'Uchi Uchi' is recorded beautifully."
It's amazing to see the process of composing music like this.
As long as we can perform on stage, we will be happy
Though only one episode has been aired so far, the biggest reason for the disbandment at this point seems to be the impression that it was caused by the environment surrounding Bitters.
When did the four people start composing music together? However, where should they perform their live? The producer and promotional people said, "Yappa Beatles are the world's number one! Let's do it!" and started talking about how they would separate from each other.
Well, the documentary also includes the director's interpretation, so whether Peter Jackson felt that way or not...

Massive Tornado Outbreak Across the U.S. as Warm and Cold Air Interact (Weather Underground)
Tornadoes were widespread across the southern U.S. overnight into Tuesday.
As a result of strong cold air from the south, the atmospheric conditions become extremely unstable, and turbulent clouds develop rapidly.
Warm, moist air from the southwest is flowing into the southern U.S., creating record highs.
In Houston, Texas, the highest temperature is expected to be near 30℃ on the 9th (Wednesday) and 10th (Friday) of local time.
In such a warm and humid area, strong cold air of -30℃ or below from the vicinity of 5500 meters above sea level has descended, resulting in the formation of an active front with a large temperature difference, causing cumulus clouds to develop rapidly along the front.
It is feared that there will be a series of earthquakes in the area.
The southern United States is a region where tornadoes tend to occur frequently, but from early summer to the end of summer, many cases of significant damage occur during this period.
The alert issued on December 1 was the 150th since the start of the year.
The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported 400-plus mph winds and 10-foot storm surges as Hurricane Michael approaches.
This suggests that there are two concentrated areas, one on the south side of the line from Kentucky to Texas, and one on the north side of the line including Illinois.
In the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF Scale), which shows the strength of tornadoes in Kentucky, an EF3, the third strongest level, is reached when a 6-rated tornado hits, and it is immediately followed by a 70 m/s tornado.
There is a possibility of being judged as EF4 or EF5 in the future survey.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese Version of the Improved Futenma Scale) is used to assess the status of Japanese buildings based on the improved Futenma Scale.
JEF3, which is equivalent to this year's American typhoon, has a high possibility of occurring in Japan, and is at the level where wooden houses can be destroyed.

Miyatake, who holds the record for the longest throw in history, is calling for a live broadcast to help him break the record - Yahoo! News
On the 11th day of the month (Japanese time on the 12th day of the month), the President of the United States, Barack Obama, showed a solution to the damage caused by the tornado in the Midwest and the South by saying that it was the largest tornado in the history of the United States.
CNN and other media reported.
Biden emphasized that he would do "anything and everything" as president.
We still don't know the full extent of the casualties, he said.
More than 100 people were killed.
[Photo] In the state of Kentucky, which was hit by tornadoes, residents carrying household items such as furniture from a destroyed house to a safe place on the night of the 10th to the morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states including Kentucky.
The record of 219 miles (350 kilometers) of damage in Mizoram state in India in 1925 remains, but meteorologist Ryan Maue of U.S. cable news channel CNN calculated the maximum at about 250 miles (400 kilometers) this time.
Massive damage was caused by a factory that operated for 24 hours straight during the Christmas shopping rush in the state of Maine.
At the time, 110 people were working, but the building was destroyed and the footprint was lost.
In the darkness, a woman trapped under about 1.5 meters of rubble was unable to move and felt the weight of the rescuers searching for her on the rubble. She asked for help from the live broadcast of Facebook.
In addition to the screams of a woman pleading for help, the voice of "Happy Birthday to You," sung through tears, was also heard during the live broadcast.
Anbar Brown, a convenience store clerk who lives in the Mayfield area, was in his basement with his 5-year-old son when the tornado warning sounded and they took cover.
There were a lot of people talking on their phones on the train, but one guy was making this really scary guttural noise.
Officials with the Memphis Police Department said the search will continue until it's no longer necessary.
We don't know how long it will take, how many months it will take, how many years it will take," he said, continuing his tireless aid work.
At least six people were confirmed dead after a warehouse owned by internet retail giant Amazon collapsed in the state of Illinois.
The train is blocked by the impact of the derailment or the influence of the vehicle overturning on the high-speed road.
About 400,000 homes and businesses, including 130,000 in Tennessee, were without power, media outlets reported.

What's the point of life insurance?
Please do your best.
If there is a lodging and/or rental apartment with a "living allowance", it is possible to ensure both the place of residence and the source of income. However, it seems that there are not many options for the current social situation.
Once upon a time, there was a website like this↓.

What kind of doctors are obstetricians and gynecologists?
"Specialist physicians" are doctors who have been practicing for 3 to 5 years after graduation.
They are also called "Specialist Doctors" and "Postgraduate Doctors."
It is said that the term "residency physician" refers to the fact that the "residency physician" refers to the first two years after graduation.

There is a long-standing belief that different approaches are needed for evaluating the stellar system.
Several foreign countries argue that Japan should take a neutral stance by adding/subtracting points based on the five criteria, while Japan argues that it should take a neutral stance by adding/subtracting points based on the three criteria.
There is a 2-star difference at the baseline, and stars 4 and 5 are "not a masterpiece but a good work" and "a masterpiece" respectively.
If a work is rated 5 out of 5 based on the 5-point rating system, it is considered to be "the best work in all respects." Therefore, if a system is designed so that works that are rated 5 out of 5 are not distinguished from works that are rated 4 out of 5, it may be necessary to add a star rating of 3 (bad) to distinguish them.
Therefore, the people who advocate for this hand's words will stop talking about Steam's 2-star rating.

Vegetables change with the seasons, but Mr. Kikuchi, who studied French cuisine, adds color with dishes like rape and ratatouille.

My heart is racing, but I'm not doing anything bad (I'm not drunk or anything).
Of course, the speed is slow.
I thought it was safe because there were people around, so I slowed down, but depending on the situation, I completely stopped.
The view around me is painful. It's good that I can be seen, but it's painful to be seen as a demon.
Overall, there is still room for improvement.
It is regrettable that there are not many people left, and that arrangements such as sending someone to the end will become easier.
Specifically, it is thought to be a good idea to make use of a dedicated lane or to walk on the left side of the road so as not to become a demon for the person who is walking ahead of you.
However, if there are fewer people, we can take our time to enjoy the scenery.
In the future, this kind of self-driving will become mainstream, so the wake of the vehicle and the discomfort of the surrounding view will become a troublesome nuisance.

One man was stabbed to death and another man escaped on a motorbike in the attempted murder on the 12th.
At around 1:25 p.m. on the 12th, a 40-year-old man from Fukuoka Prefecture was stabbed with a knife by a man in his 30s to 40s on the 1st Chome of Daiichi Street in Saga City.
The man got away on a bike and Suffolk police are investigating the attempted murder.
According to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, there were 110 cases in which pedestrians said "I'm crossing" and were hit.
The male had a length of about 10 inches and a depth of about one inch on the left side, but he was conscious.
The man who fled was wearing a skinhead.
A knife believed to have been used in the attack was found nearby.
He had been drinking with a group of people and was trying to find out if there was any traffic trouble between the male pedestrian and the male cyclist.

Family with deep roots in China's overseas environmental protection activities (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Goto Yoshihiro: Consultant for Find Asia companies in Hong Kong) China, with its vast territory, is also important in terms of biodiversity, and the species of mammals living there are ranked first in the world, and the species of plants are ranked third in the world.
Regions that recognize the value of biodiversity as a self-governing entity and promote environmental activities in addition to the protection carried out by the self-governing entity exist.
Yunnan Province, located in southwestern China, is also one of the regions.
Ms. Li Yang, the girl's mother, is now an actress. Laos and Myanmar share a border with the region where the "Tai (Tai)" ethnic group, which shares the same ethnicity as the Thai people in Thailand and the Rohingya in Myanmar, and many other ethnic minorities live.
The source of the Mekong River flows through the countries of Southeast Asia.
The Xishuangbanna Autonomous Prefecture of the Yi Nationality (also known as the Yi Autonomous Prefecture of Xishuangbanna) is only about 0.2% of the total area of China, but it is home to about 25% of China's wild animal species and 20% of its plant species.
This time, I went to see Mr. Li Zhangguo, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Xishuangbanna, and asked him about the content of the activities.
Dutch couple start environmental protection activities together - They have been engaged in environmental protection activities for 20 years.
What kind of thing was that?
Since 2000, our environmental protection activity "Tian Zhi" has been launched.
That was my husband, Josef Margraf.
The husband is from Germany and came to Seychelles for the UN-China contract scientific project.
This is the only tropical rainforest region in China, and it boasts a diverse range of flora and fauna.
However, on the other hand, economic development has been delayed.
As a result, in order to establish an industry in this region, China has been carrying out large-scale logging in the tropical rainforest.
The husband was sent here from Germany for the restoration of natural resources and the study of biological resources.
So I'm here with a reporter who knows me and knows I'm married.
Did Lee not have an interest in natural conservation before?
Although I am from Seville, I have no interest in the importance and biodiversity of tropical rainforests.
As a result, he became a husband and a project promoter without any knowledge.
Even if the face is well-proportioned, if the back is not high, there is a tendency to look down on the person, but why do you think that?

Ora is not looking for anything in particular.

I think about it too much.
There isn't much to go on, so it's hard to know what to say.
Can you elaborate on that?

【おま環／個人的備忘】MOD自環境でCTDの原因となっていて、約1か月半同定に時間がかかったもの
Due to the lack of time to play GW until the end of March, the CTD was caused by multiple factors, and it was very difficult to determine the time.
Why not use the .NET Script Framework for log analysis? (It will take a few minutes to understand.) The .dll series and assembly-related errors are not included in crash logs.
The main timing of CTD
* All PAPILUS and .NET Script Framework, and log left type .dll plug-in logs are deleted.
* NPC kill/attack accumulation: Consoled kill also activates → Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree氏SE update re-release) OFF improves ※ Is this possible for this?
* English Translation: * Camera work for NPCs: Improve the camera work for NPCs by using the .ini file to turn off the camera settings on the PC: DAR+Nemesis relationship settings? However, the maximum number of DAR animations is limited to 10,000.
* (Outside basic house) Field movement + one magic (e.g. Hydrogen Ring) activation, NPC death time: Dirt & Blood v2.0 SPID utilization NPC application settings (MCM on the right upper corner) all OFF for 5 consecutive attempts to improve.
Is it caused by an additional piece of armor or a body mesh shader setting for an actor/NPC? In any case, the default SPID usage in 2.0 SPID.ini has a syntax error, but the result is intended to be applied to NPCs with the Perk applied.
At first, I focused on checking the motion/battle MODS (DLL files) for unit attacks and OnHit relations, but I got such a result.
We have not received any similar bug reports in English, German or French.
If there are many people who are dealing with similar CTD issues in the Japanese language environment, it is possible that they may be overlooked as a reference.
Everyone's talking about it.
Around it, there is no one, even his colleagues.
If you look around, you can see that that person is very happy working hard, so it's natural to think that.
However, it may be too much for him.
He himself does not intend to retire, but he thought that the limit had been reached just before retiring.
Reflecting on the importance of mental health check-ups - Today's check-up is over
As someone with a disability, I have been receiving long-term care and visiting nursing services for a long time. However, I think that the nursing staff at the visiting nursing station I am currently using (female) is very friendly and has a good relationship with me.
We talk about all sorts of things every week.
Of course, the things necessary for pharmaceutical management (such as packaging) will be provided. However, I thought it would be important for people with mental illnesses to have fun communication as much as possible.
Today, we talk about gender differences and argue or laugh about gender theory.
"Do you want to talk about your husband's sexual desires, or how your wife left you, or something like that? Is it appropriate to talk about such things in a nursing home?"
However, there were times when I dressed as a woman.
However, in the case of visiting nursing stations in psychiatric hospitals, the nurses who used to work in the wards are no longer there, and the visiting nurses who come for work therapy are not able to give instructions from above like "This is a medical facility, so..." because they are not familiar with the facility.
The one I'm using is a small visiting nursing station operated by a social welfare corporation, but I think it would be good to have a good caregiver like Frank, who has mental illness.
You're so beautiful when you smile.
Those who have received psychological counseling will be relieved, and those who are considering it will also be relieved.
Visiting is very helpful for people with mental illness.
If the doctor confirms it, please accept it.
And choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, even if I was angry, I couldn't do anything because I had a contract.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you mean by "偽警告なのはわかってるんですけど英語で出てきてビビりました." Could you please provide more context or clarify your request?
Why are they speaking English?
Things that might be considered reasons include:
I don't know what the person who made it said in Japanese.
Lack of language proficiency
The browser is set to English.
The number of appearances in the top 6 is less than the number of odd-numbered rankings,
Why are prime numbers so long?

Coronavirus turned me into a teleworker.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patent, China's 51% of 1... "Hydrogen supply logistics lagging behind" (in Japanese) - Yahoo! News Japan
The South Korean government released the hydrogen roadmap in 2019.
Until 2022, it was planned to popularize 65,000 fuel cell vehicles (accumulative) and operate 310 hydrogen stations nationwide.
The target price of iodized salt is 6,000 won (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, the fuel cell vehicles meet only 27% of the target (about 17,000 vehicles).
The timeline for the popularization of the nuclear infrastructure hydrogen station is also 38% of the target (about 117 sites), and the hydrogen price per kilometer is 8,400 watts, which is the same as the load map published at the time of announcement.
It has become apparent that the government's roadmap for decommissioning its stockpile of plutonium is significantly behind schedule.
On the 12th, the National Federation of Saving and Credit Cooperatives (All-Japan Federation of Saving and Credit Cooperatives, hereinafter referred to as "All-Japan Federation of Saving and Credit Cooperatives") released a report entitled "Current Situation and Policy Direction of Hydrogen Saving and Credit Cooperatives".
According to the report, the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are almost entirely dependent on the United States and Japan.
The core material of the fuel cell vehicle is supplied by Toshiba (Japan), platinum catalyst by Kyocera (Japan), membrane by DuPont (USA), GORE (USA), and 3M (USA).
The number of water technology patents held by the six countries leading the world's hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has been increasing by an average of 14% per year since 2014.
According to the number of patents in the field of hydrogen production and fuel cells (2014-2020), South Korea ranked fifth in the world.
However, the entire series conveyed the message that "in fact, six countries account for the majority of the world's hydrogen market, and in reality, they are ranked lower than the competing countries."
The national patent ranking is in order of China, the United States, EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has overtaken the US to become the world's top economy, and is widening the gap.
The number of patents registered in 2020 ranked Japan in fourth place with 974 cases, but China ranked second with 4721 cases, accounting for 22% of the total.
The Japan Atomic Energy Agency proposed that "national strategic technologies" should be designated for which the investment and research and development expenses of hydrogen technology should be excluded.

and the creation of the TV-Ban group.
[Takayama] The Town Council is carrying out unique council reforms such as the creation of a charter and the introduction of a "communication folder" for citizens to evaluate their councilors.
The town council election is a three-term consecutive uncontested election, and it is aimed at the town residents.
To promote the upcoming Tuesday meeting on the 12th day of the month, approximately 1,800 copies of the new Chirashi were distributed by newspaper folding on the 9th day of the month.

Military aid, ammunition arrive in Ukraine as troops train (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) US Customs and Border Protection reported that equipment containing firearms and ammunition arrived in Ukraine based on the aid program that was approved by the Ukrainian President.
Military aid is equivalent to 60 million dollars (about 6.8 billion yen) and the final equipment including the radar for identifying the launching site of the missile such as mortar is shipped to Ukraine.
According to Cubbage, a Pentagon spokesperson, these aids included deadly weapons such as the tank missile "Javelin".
The military aid is aimed at strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities, such as the deployment of additional troops along the Ukrainian border with Russia.
Japan has warned Russia about its military movements, and has agreed with NATO allies to respond to Russian aggression in Ukraine.
On September 1st of this year, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, visited the White House and admitted to providing weapons assistance.
U.S. military aid to Ukraine has reached about $45 million this year.
Russia's aid to Ukraine's Crimean peninsula has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The US military is also involved in Ukraine's training mission.
Last month, Florida sent troops to Ukraine in support of the multinational training mission there.
According to the statement of the Ministry of Defense of the United States, the US special forces in Europe will play a significant role in the training and advice of Ukrainian special forces.
The number of US troops operating in Ukraine is not publicly known as a matter of operational security.
On the 7th of this month, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, held an online conference with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin. However, in Ukraine, there was a tense standoff.
In the event of an attack, the United States has shown the ability to impose harsh economic sanctions.

Before his death, he instructed to "ban" the donation to "handcuffs" and the donation tax "examination". He directly attacked Goshi Hara, the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party tax investigation committee!
The first special edition of "Weekly Diamond" on December 18th features "Talking with Family at the Beginning and End of the Year!"
This is the art of "bribery and corruption."
While discussions on the integration of consumption tax and corporate tax are advancing, the 2022 annual tax reform bill, which has been postponed, will likely become a "no-go" area for intergenerational bequeaths in the near future.
How will the subsequent rules change?
Together with the direct confrontation with the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party and the member of the House of Representatives, Mr. Yoshihiko Noda, and the donation for the merger of the parties, we will pass on the basic knowledge of tax techniques to the next generation.
(Diamond Editing Department, Kawakami Takashi)
The pre-death bequests to be utilized by the urban companies from the stockholders will be "handcuffed" by the "corporate income tax and withholding tax will be more integratedly caught and taxed" from the viewpoint of neutral tax system construction for the selection of the period of the capital transfer.
In one of the documents released by the party yesterday regarding the tax reform bill for 2021, there are significant fluctuations in the middle class.
The reason for this is that the thing to be avoided is to change the concomitant rules and make the "pre-payment" which is the way of the concomitant tax, a "prohibited act" by changing the concomitant tax into a large-scale tax.
The sword of tax countermeasures against high accumulated tax is "to reduce the taxable income subject to tax".
The most generous pre-death bequests have been widely used by companies to trigger inheritance tax by having employees who own homes in the three major metropolitan areas.
In such a situation, the discussion on the integration of the corporate tax and the withholding tax was dropped.
In the 22nd Annual Tax Reform Draft released on December 10th, which was intended to be the fastest-introduced tax reform bill, there were phrases such as "to see through the current progressive tax system and inheritance tax system" and "the non-taxable transfer of inheritance tax is a system that does not impose any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the scope of the limit within the family" and so on. These phrases were revised to emphasize the integration policy.
In this edition, the former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's tax investigation committee and the former chief cabinet secretary said.
"It is of utmost importance to retain benefits and avoid disadvantages during the period of asset relocation, and to continue to bear the same tax burden regardless of when it is carried out."
What kind of issues will come up in the future, and how to deal with them through integration, that is the question we are trying to answer through this simulation. The chance to make the last-minute corrections will be left for the remaining three times.
In any case, it would be a mistake to cut a large loophole in the direction of invalidating bequests as a tax measure in the near future.
What are the specific changes to the rules on concurrent tax and gift tax?

[NFL] The team that won the 1st game 3 times, how did the players feel about it (BBM Sports - Yahoo! News)
The pass that Jones threw was intercepted by Peterson three times.
This was only the second time in the past 50 years that the Bills have had back-to-back wins over the Jets, the last coming in the third week of the 1974 season.
In 1974, there was a genius RB, O.J. Simpson, who exceeded 2,000 yards for the first time in history in the Buffalo Bills.
The Bulldogs had Simpson and one-time RBJim Braxton's run game to thank for the win.
The main reason for Peyton's extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town located near the Canada-US border, and is not on the direct route of the Trans-Canada Highway.
And that day, the temperature dropped by almost one degree Celsius, and the wind speed increased to 18 meters per second, blowing snow before the race.
Bulldogs have made just one change to their home side, with Preece the only alteration.
Run 25 times in 30 seconds.
Alex's drive was 15/30, 145 yards.
The interception was unsuccessful, and the decision was left undecided.
In the 10-game offensive series, the Red Zone invasion was 4 times and there was a touchdown.
In particular, the decline since the end of the third quarter has continued for three consecutive quarters.
However, it was only able to win 3 points out of 3 in FG1.
The final goal of the match.
The building in pursuit of a 4-pointer is 3rd & 9 and becomes 3rd & 14.
The goal was 18 yards.
On 3rd and 14, QB Allen was sacked and fumbled, recovered by the Patriots.
He then tried to take out Teddson Nucks of Endzone but was unsuccessful.
In this race, Es Wrstefon Digus, who was in the right outside lane, overtook Sharoakros and became free in front of Endzone, but he did not enter the field of view of Alan.
On 4th & 18, Allen sacked WR Gabrielle Davis from the left side, but the pass was intercepted by Pittsburgh DB Mike Mitchell in front of him, ending the drive.
Bryant was covering WR Calvin Ridley of the Buccaneers, but released the coverage when he saw Allen moving and reacted to the pass.
Aren, who lost two receivers, threw an end zone pass on two consecutive plays.
Although the 4th down pass was crucial, the 3rd down pass was unnecessary.
A win in either of the next two games will be enough to take the series.
Because he was only 2 minutes away from the 4th and short, he couldn't help but think of his own running ability.

Slowly but surely, "throwaway" and "replacement" items that can be used in the kitchen for a long time are selected as the top 3 items (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
Sponge
SpongeBob SquarePants has been on the air for 20 years, and it's still going strong.
From research in 2017, it was found that even if kitchen sponges were sanitized every day with an electric toothbrush, they could still harbor a lot of bacteria (though sanitizing with an electric toothbrush is still a good thing).
German researchers who conducted the study recommend swapping sponges every day for a week to maintain cleanliness.
Mana board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture is advising farmers to check their irrigation systems for cracks and leaks before turning on the water.
At first, it was difficult to keep the wound clean and free from infection, and the bacteria proliferated.
If you're still breastfeeding, don't forget to sanitize frequently with a solution of unscented liquid bleach in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Soak the surface of the board in liquid for a few minutes.
The water is clear, so I use a clean paper towel to soak up the water gently.
Food scraps or leftovers
While it may be uncomfortable to dispose of the mucus cup, the surface left behind will become a new breeding ground for bacteria and fungi.
It is also caused by biting the lip or choking on food.

Why is it embarrassing to carry a branded product?

It has nothing to do with the Gagarin wind.
It's better to say it at the beginning, "What's up, are you going to call me only when you need something?"
If that's the case, it's better to say it bluntly.
I'm thinking about it with a high probability, so I can't help but think about it even in my dreams.
Although I lived in the middle of the sea overseas, the Japanese people who came to visit me outside were worried that I might be kidnapped by North Korean spies.
If seen by Europeans, I would like to be a kind-hearted person without malice.

However, it is not enough for the yen to simply be at par with the US dollar. It must be at par with the US dollar in terms of purchasing power, so that the exceptional devaluation of the yen will not occur.
I can't understand what you're saying because you're speaking in Japanese.
Henshaw: My white friend from high school who's back in town for the holidays always drinks faster than me at karaoke.
I think it's a good habit for Japanese people to be aware of their surroundings even if they are not paying attention, so that they can avoid embarrassment in the future.
Japanese people tend to look down on someone who lives in a cramped space, regardless of their personality (including me).

Since I don't have the ability to understand English to some extent, I will judge based on the translated text only.
The translated text may convey a slight sense of dissatisfaction in the article, but I think it is at a level where there is no obstacle to playing it (I think it is at a level where I can play it even if I feel this way).
The translation of this level for games made overseas is often seen, but it is well translated when it is made by a small company.
I think that people who are not native Japanese speakers can understand the subtle nuances of the language through long-term practice.
I'm not sure what level you're looking for, but if a Japanese person is looking for a level where they don't feel embarrassed, then it's good to look for other people.

"The Equal Exchange of Efforts" is the theme song of the anime "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"
In the recent manga, "The Demon's Blade" is different from the original work.
It has become a truism that the Battle Royale genre is not popular among readers.
Though it took two years of rehabilitation after separating from his beloved Mazura in the same manga "One Piece", it is known that he was able to regain his ability to fly with just a touch.
Moreover, Wanpaku is attracted to the eclectic atmosphere of the land to cross, and there are few things that are not compatible with "staying at the same place for rehabilitation."
Thus, the protagonist of "Gintama", Gintoki Sakata's training to become a samurai was based on the fact that he was seated on the ground in front of the grave of the man who had helped him with his life, Yorozuya Gyoubu, and said, "You can't seize the right to kill and take someone else's life!".
The weak do not have the right to choose or the right to vote, and they are constantly oppressed by the strong.
At some point, the hopeful recruiters of the Kirakira Force will introduce the "Growth" area near the left side of the screen, which is a commendable feature (even if it is not explained).
The first contact between Hiroshi and Ryota was when Hiroshi asked, "What should I do when my girlfriend cheats on me?" and Ryota replied, "You're too slow," at once.
Among the fans, there is a lively exchange of words and endless chatter.
However, there is a possibility that the moment the girl turns into a demon, she will become pregnant.
It is an initiation to enter the practice from the perspective of the heart.
However, he dragged the unrepentant Dosu, who had not undergone rehabilitation, to the foot of the mountain and left him there until dawn.
The mountain is covered with caves and traps, and if you fall into them, you will die before entering the cave.
Even so, with the sharp sense of smell inherited from his previous life, he was able to sniff out the scent of a woman who had been touched by a man's hand, and was able to avoid it by becoming a "master detective".
Even so, "If you can avoid it all of a sudden, you won't lose your physical strength so quickly even if you can't use your abilities!" said Kuroyukihime.
Ordinary people will not suddenly become strong without any preparation, but they will be able to use the power and technique they have cultivated so far as their original potential.
Those who have striven will be rewarded for their efforts, but those who have not will not be punished for their lack of effort. The "Equivalent Exchange of Efforts" is a rule where those who possess extraordinary power without a foundation are humbled by humans, and it is a difficult rule that is consistent throughout the work.
Is that old?
Until now, he has been sleeping on the floor without a bed, covering the floor with a mat and sleeping on a quilt or a blanket.

That's what I would do.

How about it?
Is the person who works as a part-timer and works full-time at another store allowed to take a break?
Well, I don't think so.
If that's the case, there's no need for me to think about it.
We think that they are aiming to get more benefits than the minimum effort by planning to put in more effort than necessary.

1500 BCE is equivalent to 1500 years before the Common Era (CE).
How do you say that in Japanese?
It was 1500 years ago.
BC is the abbreviation for Before Christ, but is it appropriate for non-Christians to use it? Based on this reasoning, the use of BCE (Before the Common Era) has become more common in recent years.
BCE stands for Before Common Era.

Tokyo, Japan - The driver of a truck involved in a 24-vehicle collision in Aichi Prefecture on Tuesday was uninjured, according to TV Asahi (ANN).
The driver of the truck, who was arrested and taken into custody, did not have any illness, and it was determined that the accident was caused by some kind of carelessness.
In the morning of the 10th day of the month, 24 trucks and passenger vehicles were involved in a collision on National Highway 41 in Xiaojiang City, and 12 people were injured.
The police arrested the suspect, a 54-year-old man who drove the trailer, on suspicion of causing an accident that resulted in the death of a 71-year-old man, and sent him for questioning on the morning of the 12th.
The train driver of the derailed train continued to move even after the accident, and firefighters confirmed that the train's brakes were applied after the accident.
However, according to the investigation, it was found that the villagers were not infected with the disease, and some kind of negligence was considered to be the cause.
Police are conducting a house-to-house search of the area and are appealing for anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious to come forward.

Gintama's Kinbaku Man Review [Comic Volume 4th Edition] - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympic Games, which began in Volume 3, will be concluded in Volume 4!
Compared to the prequel that depicted the match from the opening ceremony to the final in one breath, the sequel is filled with new twists and turns!
"Kin-chan" Volume 4 Review Submitter: Ogimama X★★★★★ (5 stars)
This four-volume set is a one-volume summary of the Kinniku Man vs. Robin Mask final match, but it does not include a detailed description of the ring match.
Starting from the Shogi style, such as each other's handicap match and specialized scenery, it has been changed and tried until now, but it is impossible to give up.
The sense of impending doom that creeps up on you as the century turns is heightened by the increasing tension in the book, and by the time you get to this section, you're practically counting down the minutes until the inevitable showdown.
And in the third-place playoff, it's a rematch of last year's final between the Terriers and Lakers.
As for the luxury of being on the card, the one I liked the most was when I was backstage before the match and the lion man was shouting at me, "From now on, it's my turn!"
Trying to get a chop.
However, the knife-wielding man was restrained by the terrified passerby, who silently wrestled him to the ground, preventing the scene from escalating further.
What is this, and why are both of them already defeated, and there's no chance to fight Kenpachi in this conference.
However, there are some people who go out of their way to be cruel.
If such a thing were to happen, it would be impossible not to think about it!
It's not that I want to become a character, but as a manga artist, I'm still suffering from this one scene!
Such fights usually end without a knockout, but the post-fight interview is with the loser.
"Give us the strength to bear the burden of the gods!"
This is a lifeline.
This is no longer a grandiose metaphorical statement about the work as a whole, but rather something that the reader has come to expect from Kinbaku Man: that the ending will be a foregone conclusion, that the main character will not be defeated, and that victory will come without effort.
However, by making this statement, Mr. Yudetamago was forced to reveal his hand.
With this one sentence, the reader says, "Oh, so that's why Kinbaku-man is so strong.
What happened? 」
Thinking about the unseen developments, it seems that Mr. Yudetamago, who is a workaholic, has set his sights on a new goal.
This is amazing.
I think the big point of this volume is that there was no mistake.

1. Open the slit for sunrise and changing clothes.

2.) After returning to the room, turn off the computer as soon as you hear the Pinklouta sound from the PC.
It was thought that the fans were not working well due to the low temperature (6℃).
So they tried again to heat the room.
3. Do nothing.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp turns on and off immediately.
Afterwards, there was no need to say it twice.
Even if you try to pull out the power plug, it takes just a moment.
4.) Try connecting the motherboard and ATX20 pins with only 4 pins connected and see if it turns on.
5.) PSU fans have been known to bark like a pack of dogs, so it's unclear if it was the cause.
Try to find an ATX power supply and test it later.
