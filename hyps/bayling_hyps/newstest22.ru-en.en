From my perspective, the literature program was developed by women of the Balzac generation based on their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very elderly Balzacian ladies.
Psychology and the torments of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenyev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Psychology of heroes is of little interest to children in general.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to represent a particular variety?
There are roses with such a colour and structure of the petals, reminiscent of velvet, usually dark red and brown tones.
And light roses look different, the petals have an Atlas or silky shine.

Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195 mattress.
The "Micro-Premium" model: comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different levels of firmness on each side: the medium-firm side is made of coconut-based latex and natural latex, while the moderately soft side is made of natural latex.
The spring block with 1000 springs per square metre quickly adapts to the body of a sleeping person, preventing the appearance of the "wave" or "gamma" effect.
Among the merits of the model it is necessary to single out breathing materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, breathes naturally like a coconut.
This helps to maintain a healthy microclimate in the bedroom.
There is also an extended warranty period for the mattress.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years, but the actual service life of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and pollution is entrusted to the detachable cover from Jacquard, supplied as standard.
Buy an orthopedic pillow for your bed - it's recommended for maintaining optimal spinal alignment during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the additives - coconut serves as an anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.
Use your brain and run such relatives out of town!

Andrey, it has been explained to you clearly that pensioners are working in schools and they will not work in a team.

So there is no support.
With horror I remember these feasts and guests in my parents' house.
Guests are at the door, and on the stove, pancakes are being fried, and the mother is scrubbing the floor.
Lord, he's so weak he can hardly sit at the table.
And then clean up the dishes, tidy up the house.
A week before the holiday, you're dragging products, two days of cleaning, and then you're done.
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well,
They are well, and the cake is always with them.
Since then I have not liked holidays, guests.
Even for his family, he covers the table minimally.
And I bake them very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth dose of coronavirus vaccine inevitable
A fourth dose will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be the final one, but will be continued with new strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, it is unlikely that two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will be enough to provide full protection.
This is what the head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigelt, believes.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday 11th December.
We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn, - the expert believes.
In addition, Waggle hopes that the fourth vaccination against the coronavirus will be conducted "in combination with the flu vaccine".
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, strengthened vaccination may help combat the spread of the new coronavirus "Omicron".
The new version is particularly dangerous.
So, the likelihood of a repeat infection with "Omicron" is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, manufacturers BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies are emphasizing that two doses of the vaccine do not provide adequate protection against infection with the new coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found the vaccine was less than 25 times less potent at the two doses.
This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the Omicron strain, BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
So a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the President of the German Association of Infectious Diseases, Bernhard Salzberger, advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
In addition, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both delta-virus and omicron-variant coronavirus.
The experience of Israel is very convincing," the expert stressed.
Vobler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a branch of the Bet-A family from the Pontoon21Â® company.
It (along with the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally designed with ice fishing in mind, as well as surf casting.
These lenses have a larger than average weight, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of their use.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin, made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional vibrations during vertical and horizontal conduction.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing in the vertical Bet-A-Vib, it shows quite aggressive play.
Often the most noticeable are simple monotonous animations, that is, movements up and down almost without pauses.
When planning the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, covered with underwater vegetation, kelp and other obstacles, which can be caught.
In addition, a small deviation is effective when catching winter shad and large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when precise and aggressive baiting is required.
When it reaches the end of its trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly rotates and returns to its original vertical position.
Bet-A-Vib has been just as successful in winter crayfish fishing.
There are two versions to suit her whims: with a noisy capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without one (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to irritate a passive shad, even if it does not react to a live bait.
Catching a stray Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This bracelet is understandable and not capricious, it combines well with lace and knitted cords, even of large diameters.
For catching crucian carp, bream, tench, and perch, in addition to the "step", sometimes with "chirping" on the bottom,
If you're fishing in snagged areas, you can switch to a double hook to reduce the risk of snagging.
Bet-A-Vib is one of the most reliable models in its class and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively small and quite deep-seated areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 screws.
How many young layabouts are sitting on the shoulders of their elderly parents.
"Golden youth" - clearly expressed layabouts in the majority, who know nothing and can do nothing.
The monotonous life leads to boredom.
Perhaps Mishustin was referring to this minority.

In Libya, it was reported that there are 7,000 Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) "Wagner" in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council, Haled al-Mishri.
At present, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the Wagner private military company in Libya.
They have planes too.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at the airbase in Ghardabiya (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) - Anadolu Agency
Haleed al-Mishri also said that Russian mercenaries are "trying to take over" central Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the publication's source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located itself in Libya".
Wagner has been operating in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Derna, the report said.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner private military company has the support of the Kremlin.
Where are the mercenaries?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is believed to be operating in nine African countries - Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection for leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, subsidiary companies "Wagner" receive certain privileges and licenses to use valuable minerals and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technologies and military services to these countries, the article says.
According to media reports, "Wagnerites" allegedly fought in Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not listed in the law enforcement agencies or the registry of legal entities, and its fighters are absent from the lists of personnel.
The company is under US sanctions.
Let's not forget that the 27 member states of the EU previously approved restrictions against "Wagner".
The Council of the European Union is expected to approve this decision on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The High National Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions, dominated by Islamists, writes TASS.
The body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single day of voting for parliamentary and presidential elections at least until February 2022.
With less than two weeks to go until the election, the chances of it happening on time are rapidly diminishing, the paper notes.
In this context, the High Election Commission of Libya postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, according to the channel Sky News Arabia.
Russian View of Foreign Policy
38% of Russians see more success in the country's foreign policy than failures, 29% think that failures prevail.
Examples of success - "defended and restored peace in Syria", "resolution on 'North Stream-2', "scared the whole world with advanced weapons", "we took Crimea".
The main failures - "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world" - are said in the study by the Foundation "Public Opinion".
The Dubai government has completely refused to use paper-based documentation â all government services are now purely digital
The Dubai government has announced a complete switch from paper-based documentation to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided to citizens exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the UAE news agency WAM.
Today marks the start of a new phase of digital transformation across all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed our transition to a fully paperless government, His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council, said on Saturday.
Now all internal and external document processing in all government agencies in Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The new initiative affects all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts and so on. Many commercial structures have also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this period, as authorities calculated, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is equivalent to 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in monetary terms.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens two days a year.
Well, yes, the date of birth and how many years the child is, that's a joke, about the class and group in the kindergarten too.
I don't believe such buffoons exist.
And if there are, they are obviously up to something, including family.
My mother, her two brothers and grandmother lived on Vladimirskaya Street, in a one-storey apartment without bars.
They knocked first on the door, then on the window, then decided not to waste time and broke the window and climbed in, but the grandfather had a baseball bat, which they got.
These people knew there was someone at home...
Turkey's car production, exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey's automobile production and export sharply decreased in November due to the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, industry figures for the 11 months to the end of November were worse than the same period last year, Bloomberg reported, citing data from the Automotive Manufacturers Association of Turkey.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were released from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75,900 vehicles were exported, which is more than 25% lower than the corresponding figure for the previous year.
And if the automotive sector in Turkey demonstrated positive dynamics compared to the previous year in the first 10 months of this year, then the production of cars in the 11 months of 2021 was already 0.3% lower than the previous year's figure.
This drop was caused by the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which was 29% cheaper against the dollar in November.
This led to a decline in economic activity across all sectors.
More than 500 subjects of the Russian Federation received a postponement of credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov told about the situation with the provision of preferences for small and medium-sized businesses, the correspondent of MIA "Kazinform" reported.
According to the information of the Agency for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021, No. 127 "On Approving the Order of Providing Deferment of Payments on Loans to Subjects of Small and Medium Business" was adopted in the current year in order to fulfill the assignment of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, - Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the parliamentary inquiry.
He reminded that the order of granting deferral of payments on loans envisaged the provision of banks and microfinance organizations with deferral of payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to entities of the MSB, including individual entrepreneurs, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The period of deferral ranged from 30 to 90 days, depending on the choice of the subject of the MSB.
In the borrower's statement, a different repayment period may be specified.
During the moratorium on the borrower, pre-litigation work, notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, and the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended, the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
For 2021, banks of the second level received applications for postponement of payments from 603 borrowers-subsidiaries of the MSB, of which 553 subsidiaries of the MSB received postponement of payments for a sum of 9.7 billion tenge.
In the Ministry of Finance, applications for postponement were received from 131 subjects of the Ministry of Social Protection, of which postponement was provided to 95 subjects for a total of 105.8 million tenge, - concluded A. Smailov.
Pneumologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the "okmilon" strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be more susceptible to it than those with strong immune systems.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryaev explained why the coronavirus "OKMIR" strain could be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions of the emergence of the virus.
Scientists believe that "okmilon" originated in the bodies of infected with HIV or suffering from immune deficiency.
In other words, with mutation he found no resistance from the immune system.
As a result, he is more aggressive.
Because there was no response from the immune system, it became very fast.
It seems that there are these spike-like proteins, spikes, maybe more than are allowed, their antibodies were not cut down during mutations, - commented pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be more susceptible to "okmilon" than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that a strong response of the body to anything, to any infection - is not always good.
In such cases the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people aged 30 die and old people aged 60 carry on coughing.
The immune response is crazy in young people, it is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with a finger, he hits like with a gun at sparrows - concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be caused by bacteria and viruses.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case you can often only treat the symptoms - all hope is on the organism.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is a fever, weakness, illness.
Then come the respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, cough in the throat, sneezing.
Pain in the right or left abdomen can also be a sign of a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, vaccination of the next generation, aged 12 to 18, may begin by the end of the year.
Virologist, head of the laboratory of genetic engineering at MFTI Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from COVID-19.
Teens who go to school have the most contact.
This is the most socially active layer, like children in kindergartens - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the laboratory of genetic engineering at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.
Great thanks to the author for this article.

Immunologists propose theory as to why obese people are more susceptible to COVID-19
The authors studied fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
Fat tissue immune cells, called macrophages, also became infected, showing strong inflammatory responses.
Scientists also studied fat tissue from patients who died of COVID-19 and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that viruses such as HIV and the flu can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir in an attempt to evade the immune system's response.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 can do this.
Biologist Explains the Causes of Dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences, Semyon Goloshchin, called the reasons for the appearance of dementia and told about the ways of its prevention in an interview with the radio Sputnik.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people are affected by this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty even in a familiar environment.
Goloshchin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiencies.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity can play a role," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by harmful habits - smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, experts noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a reduction in abstract thinking.
There is a debate as to whether hearing loss is an early sign of Alzheimer's disease or one of the risk factors for its development, the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical fitness, training cognitive skills and abilities that involve memory and logic.

Egypt Returns About 30,000 Illegally Exported Artefacts
Over the past 10 years, the Egyptian government has managed to repatriate around 30,000 artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country through the black market.
This was announced by the main inspector of the department of returned antiquities at the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, Shaaban Abdel Gawad, on Saturday, 11 December, on the channel Al-Hayat.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered in the Museum of Bible in Washington, he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all artifacts smuggled out of the country are registered in archives.
Now department staff are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions worldwide and sales on the internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The main inspector said that when the cultural relics are restored, they will be exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol to help find a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Christie's auction house sold the bust for $5.97 million (about 68 million rubles) on July 4.
This caused dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the god Amen-Ra, has been in a private collection and not been sold at auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient relics illegally removed from the country over the years.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a distinct ethnic group (closely related to Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (from Kazan) live in Crimea (see the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate nation, and the name of this nation consists of two words!
They are united by the Turkish language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse is asking its staff to allow the bank access to their personal mobile devices, according to the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, Swiss banks do not issue corporate devices to their employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, banks can look at information on corporate devices issued to their employees as long as they are being used for business purposes, such as communicating with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to arrange a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees are working remotely, the bank wants to extend the rule to all devices used for work purposes.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management set a deadline for employees to become familiar with the new rule.
Officials at Credit Suisse declined to comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life - 1925 - was productive in terms of his creative work, but was a difficult year for the poet and his "ego" in terms of their earthly existence.
He is no longer associated with any literary groups, rants about Imagism, he himself, but is known, in demand, sometimes abused by critics, even angrily, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their arms.
More than 60 poems were written in a year, many of them true masterpieces, the cycle of "Persian motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, a collection "Soviet Russia".
And the main success - on the 25th of June, Gosizdat signed a contract with Yessenin on the publication of his works in three volumes.
No contemporary poet has been so honoured by Sergei Alexandrovich, he is the first!
In addition, it was very well paid - according to the contract, the monthly remuneration was 1000 rubles for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles a month, the engineer - 200).
Money was needed more than ever that year.
Esenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy, Sofia Tolstaya, and had to arrange his family life, take care of his sisters Katya and Sasha, and his mother.
Life seemed to be getting back to normal, there was something to celebrate, but for him everything was coloured mainly in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yessenin's death) had materialised:
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Or the wind is blowing
Over the vast and empty plain,
So, as in September,
Alcohol is bad for your brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Esenin looked very ill, poorly, obviously ill.
There are more and more outbursts, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason, probably, is not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no documents left.
Let's say, referring to May 1923, when Esenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan, was recovering from illness at the clinic in Paris under the guidance of Professor Peter Gannushkin (two years later, Esenin will meet him again in Moscow).
And here are the poet's testimonies, scandals on this topic, reports to the police - scattered across dozens of memoirs.
From the early 20s, the terrible romance of the poet with the green snake rapidly developed.
In the late summer of 1923, Esenin moved in with his friend, the impressionist Ivan Starcev.
Surprisingly, but with his very good income, Yessenin never had his own home in either Moscow or St. Petersburg. He rented apartments, stayed in hotels or with friends.
Starkov recalls:
He only came to sleep, and in most cases in an incomprehensible, drunk state.
Once, returning at four in the morning, Esenin fell on the stairwell...
Falling, he scraped his face and whimpered.
When he came to, he started coughing up blood, spewing it all over the place...
And even Esenin, after travelling around Europe and the USA (dry law in the States at the time, but Duncan smuggled in a decent supply of spirits), admitted:
I saw nothing there but cabarets and streets...
I'm almost at the end and people have stopped remembering...
Well, of course...
I drank because I was lonely."

What on earth are you talking about?
Polish MID believes Belarus uses migrants as "weapon" against EU
Polish MID believes Belarus uses migrants as "weapon"
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as "weapons" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operations" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus have "temporarily stopped Lukashenko," but he is "actively looking for new ways."
The Polish official is also convinced that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons "in many parts of the world".
According to the website kp.ru, the European Union previously introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 physical persons and 11 organizations.
Europe has said it is ready to impose further sanctions on the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve".
In response, Minsk introduced a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to introduce sanctions against Belarus.

At the premiere of the film "Not Time to Die" in September, he appeared in a velvet maroon jacket and a traditional "Bond girl" bowler hat.
Prince William followed in his father's footsteps twice, first donning an inappropriate green velvet jacket for the Earthshot Prize ceremony, before opting for a more traditional look for the Royal Variety performance in aid of charity.
A couple of weeks ago the trend was taken up by Lionel Messi.
The footballer came to collect his seventh "Golden Boot" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress has already noted the growing demand for silk men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the "Gazeta.Ru" service, their sales increased by 1.4 times.
The most popular are warm tweed jackets with padding and a fitted silhouette, the main colours are dark brown, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is between 3,000 and 6,000 rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - suits made of real leather they choose less often.
They can be bought not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury jacket segment in this season, almost all brands - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, Saint Laurent - are represented.
The most coveted is the Gucci model, in which the ambassador for the brand, Jared Leto, appeared at one of the premieres of the "Gucci House" film.
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special weaving technology, a dense fabric with a wavy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
Budget versions are made of cotton or polyamide, but serve for less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhshin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket the main thing is not its model or cut, but appropriateness.
A velvet jacket is perfect for evening events, so it's ideal if you're going to a party or a formal occasion - explains Vakhshin. - It's also suitable for cases when the dress code is specified as "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" in the invitation.
Another important criterion is the status of the buyer.
A man in a velvet jacket, primarily, should acquire the right trendy suit with enough - the authors of the Telegram-channel about men's fashion "Krasavchik Brammell" think. - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to secular events where the dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhshin suggests combining a baroque jacket with matching items: classic trousers with stripes, monochrome shirts, silk ties, cufflinks, suspenders.
Too mundane things will look out of place.
Trendy experts from "Brammell's Beauties" are sure that it would be inappropriate for a regular office worker to appear in a velvet jacket, but if it is about a "manager among those who manage this event, then - yes", such a thing would be appropriate for him.
If you are a lower-ranking employee whose goal is to move up the corporate ladder or to earn financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a suit.
The management will assess this exactly with the phrase "not for Sanya cap", - the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion think.
Very mixed feelings about the voice.
This is an unusual tone, so tiredly drags.
And has nothing to do with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of those around me.
But from the bottom of my heart, I wish you success in life!
It's all about the money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Do they mourn?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is not in short supply - gas, oil and coal are cheaper to buy than they are to sell.
There is a huge demand for fuel.
The kitten is purring.
Who was flying then?
As usual - a regular buyer.
Are Indian issues troubling the sheriff?
Therefore, it is not necessary to consider Western politicians as idiots, who "forgot" about the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good cause.
Didn't see one attractive person in any of the pics in the article.
Just mediocrity for the average passenger.
Perhaps, if such characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole train, they are unlikely to attract such people.
But only because of psychological disorders and ignorance of such "beauties" (-ies), but not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who recognizes his slave status and struggles against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who does not know that he is a slave and is living in a silent, unconscious, and speechless life of slavery is simply a slave.
A slave, whose saliva flows when he proudly describes the pleasures of slavery and the good and kind master, is a slave, a buffoon."
Immunologist says vaccination within 4-5 months will help protect against coronavirus 'omega' strain
Boosting the immune system with a vaccine within four to five months could protect against a new coronavirus strain, "Omega".
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the six-month interval between vaccinations, taking into account the emergence of new strains, "a very long period"
Previously, such a period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure five months after the start of the vaccination campaign, and for people with chronic diseases - four, - the expert said, calling for revaccination alongside the vaccination campaign.
Krychkov also noted that early vaccination ensures good titers of neutralizing antibodies.
If a person has had two jabs and a booster, or has had chickenpox and been vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and had chickenpox, then they have 'mixed immunity', meaning they have enough antibodies to neutralise the virus, the expert explained.
'Big seven' warned Russia of 'major consequences' if it invaded Ukraine
The "Big Seven" countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that "military aggression" by Russia against Ukraine will have "enormous consequences" for Moscow, but the document does not describe specific measures.
We, the ministers of foreign affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine, the statement reads.
Next, the ministers called on Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and respect its international commitments on military transparency," as President Biden said during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
We confirm our support for France and Germany's efforts in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the foreign ministers of the "Big Seven" also stated.
The use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and serious costs in response, they warn.
We confirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's measured position.
We will intensify our cooperation in response to our common and comprehensive needs," the statement also said.
Earlier today, the head of the British diplomatic service, Elizabeth Truss, said that Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her words, this meeting showed "the united voice of the 'Big Seven' countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which clearly showed that an invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia".
Pfizer vaccine deemed 32 times less effective against Omicron strain
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times less effective than other forms of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, according to South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on the study of antiviral activity in civilians who received two doses of the drug against COVID-19.
We see that the majority of people had high levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus, but this ability was significantly reduced against the beta variant, Prof Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease when infected with the coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus epidemic taking into account the influence of the Omicron strain.
The authors of the study came to the conclusion that the Omicron strain could cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and increase mortality if additional measures are not taken.
Ukrainian Defense Minister Accuses Germany of Blocking Supplies of NATO Weapons to Kiev
Ukrainian Defense Minister Alexei Reznikov accused the former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government of blocking Kiev's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznian reminded that Germany had vetoed the purchase of anti-sniper systems and assault rifles for drones by Ukraine last month.
At the same time, it was noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to acquire the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this refers to the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the new German government, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, has yet to clarify its position on the supply of weapons to Ukraine.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrey Melnyk, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect deliveries of weapons from Berlin to Chancellor Scholz.
According to his words, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of military escalation of the conflict in Donbas, despite the "occupation of Russia" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "unreasonable" position, the diplomat is confident, Germany will retain even with a new Chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kiev expected Berlin to help equip its naval fleet.
Ukraine is counting on Germany "being a partner in a technical sense," the President added.
It was also noted that the co-chairman of the German Green Party, Robert Habeck, visited the republic in the spring of the current year, where he spoke in favour of selling Kiev defensive weapons.

Ways to get back money stolen from online shops revealed
There are several ways to get your money back if it has been stolen from an online store and avoid falling victim to fraud in the future.
This was revealed by experts in information security in an interview with RBC.
Therefore, to reduce the risk of large losses in case the bank card falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend keeping a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen as a result of purchases made in stores that do not use the 3D Secure security technology, you can initiate a refund process.
In accordance with the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility is borne by the participant in the chain of transactions who does not use this service, - the representative of Promsvyazbank specified.
International payment provider Ecommpay expert Arthur Zeremba stressed that the buyer has the right to lodge a complaint with the bank within 120 days of the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return the money to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the League for Safe Internet, Ekaterina Minzulina, reported that in 2021 alone, 11,000 cases of fraud were received, ranging from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her words, an effective solution to the current situation may be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss "Nord Stream 2" and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the Polish judiciary, the increase of Russian troops on the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "Nord Stream-2".
While Scholz said he was committed to preserving good relations between Germany and Poland for the long term, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would call on Scholz to oppose the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline, which is planned to bring Russian gas to Germany via Ukraine.
According to Moravec, Russia may use the gas pipeline as a means of political pressure against Europe.
Germany, in turn, supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to get into the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels in resolving the crisis.
However, the Polish legal system remains one of the causes of disagreements.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, ruling that the country's right-wing "Law and Justice" party's judicial reforms violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its Supreme Court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, has not taken on public commitments to stop work on the "Nord Stream 2" pipeline in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, despite demands from Poland and the United States.
U.S. officials told members of Congress they have reached an agreement with Germany to halt the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior congressional aide said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm the reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of consequences if Russia were to violate Ukrainian borders, and that position was reiterated by "Big Seven" representatives on Sunday.
Dmitry, look closer.
The view through the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.

And those who are not familiar with the initial layout are skeptical.
And I know such apartments very well and I can see very well how it was replanned.
Good luck to them.
It always surprises me when people write about cleaning tools to clean shells, toilets, sinks, cranes.
You see them once a year at Easter, that's if you're lucky, otherwise you have to wash them yourself.
Just don't pollute.

Thieves who found money in the wall of a church will be paid $20,000
Plumber who found $20,000 in wall of Texas church will get reward
This is according to a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at the Lakewood megachurch, where Pastor Joel Osteen promises his devout followers that they will prosper and be successful.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cully was repairing one of the church's toilets when he found a thousand packets of cash and cheques under the insulation.
He turned it over to the church, he said, and never heard back from Austin.
I wanted to hear him say: 'You did the right thing, Justin.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The find is believed to be connected to a theft that took place in the Lakewood church seven years ago.
At the time, around $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks were stolen from the church safe.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
However, a reward of $25,000 was offered for information about the perpetrators.
Justin Cooling could not claim the money as the deadline for the award had passed.
Despite that, the nonprofit Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time offered a $5,000 reward and later received an additional $20,000 from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Austin about money found in the wall of the Lakewood church.
Tania, her statements, her actions - that is her characteristic "as a real person".
Therefore, it is so negative towards her.
And the matter is not that "she is financially much richer than all the writers," as it is written here.
There are people who are richer, but not all of them behave as boldly and provocatively as this lady.

Brazil requires citizens to show proof of vaccination upon entry
Brazil has mandated requiring a COVID-passport from those entering the country, a decision made by Federal Supreme Court Judge Luis Roberto Barroso.
This was reported by CNN Brasil.
People with contraindications to vaccination are exempted from presenting a certificate of vaccination.
Also excluded from the list are individuals who have arrived from countries where the vaccine has not been proven to be effective.
The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival and Carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in the flow of tourists, he said.
Earlier, Brazilian authorities required unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
Scheme for full protection against COVID-19 revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Alchevsky in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme for complete protection against the coronavirus infection.
He said this could be achieved by introducing injection and oral vaccines.
When given intramuscularly, antibody A is produced in large quantities. When the vaccine is given by injection, this does not happen.
Antibodies A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And within us, after vaccination, the most is formed of immunoglobulin G (antibodies).
And if you get both vaccines, you're going to make a lot of antibody A and G. But we don't have a policy for double vaccination yet," the doctor said.
The chief sanitary doctor of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergei Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in combination with injections is the possibility of ceasing to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help as in such cases the body's defence should be at its maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Guseynov said that the spread of a new coronavirus among children will lead to a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, such a picture is observed in other countries, where the next wave of the epidemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to my lover (who died a long time ago) like this - if you're ready to give up your warm home, the cradle, love, and games with a wet nurse, then let's go.
But Pisel was trained and generally smart.
My society chose me and I went home.
On the video, which works in 90% of cases.
Don't take it from me, trust me.
I held back many owners so that they wouldn't run after the dog, although they were shouting that it was theirs, 200,000 people are running away (pomskies), grabbed her hand and dragged her to the other side.
In the end, "200,000" chose the owner, not the dog that had run off somewhere.
Massive anti-vax protests continue in Europe
More than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets of the Austrian capital, Vienna.

A major protest against the sanitary passport took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a COVID-19 certificate is required to access bars, restaurants, sports halls, retirement homes and night-time entertainment venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was taken by the authorities of several regions of the country against the background of the growing number of cases of infection with the coronavirus.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then turned into clashes with riot police.
Protesters started hurling stones at police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nicholas II, even in Wikipedia, there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashchevarova-Rudneva is also described as "the first Russian doctor of medicine," perhaps because she started her studies earlier.

WHO found "omicron" in several dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new coronavirus strain "Omega" has been detected in 63 countries.
Some experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO said in a statement.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the virus had been detected in 63 countries and all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it has only been actively spreading since the end of November.
The WHO also expressed concern about the rapid spread of the new coronavirus variant.
Experts from the WHO expressed concern that the new strain, based on preliminary data, could outstrip the spread of the "delta" strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all but one country.
Before that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the Omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also been reached in the UK.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine believe that "omicron" will replace "delta" in the coming months.
In Britain alone, around 100,000 people are estimated to have been infected, although the true figure is likely to be several hundred times higher.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, with hospitals seeing more than 20,000 people a day at peak.
The British healthcare system will not be able to cope with this.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the "omicron" strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian satellite "Sputnik V" will react to the "omicron" - this will become clear in the coming weeks.
The Gamalei Centre has only just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the "omicron" strain.

And they were raised practically according to God's laws (love thy neighbour, don't steal and so on).

Our Petersburg, that is, Leningrad communal apartment with Big Zelenina still supports communication.
Of course, we're not the closest of friends, but we do try to keep in touch.
Perhaps this is connected to the fact that there was no apartment for the guests, the room was not rented, and the blockade brotherhood was not cancelled.
Sadly, we are seeing them more and more at funerals.

$135 billion went into applications - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending on apps worldwide increased by 25%, while the number of downloads increased by 8%.
The most popular in the world are various video services.
Most users were downloading the video editor CapCut, and spending the most time on YouTube.
And the number of downloads of applications and expenses of users showed a significant increase from January to November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. More significantly, spending by users on applications increased by 25%, reaching a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from the lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.
Will such a "return to physical" growth in the economy of applications slow down? Not at all, believe the authors of the report.
India is the leader in terms of the number of downloads of applications: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
The US (9%) and Brazil (8%) follow.
iOS users, as before, spend more than Android users: 65% of all app spending is on iOS.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took first place in terms of the number of downloads in 2021.
Two Indian apps follow: video service MX TakaTak and e-commerce app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 for the number of downloads.
In general, based on the number of downloads, among users, popular VPN services (two of which are in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to video creation and transmission (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak in the top 10, there are two more such services - Moj and SnackVideo).
Users spent the most time in apps for live streaming and online streaming, the authors note.
Leading the way is YouTube, with the top five also including video service TikTok, streaming services Disney+ and HBO Max, and Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok take the top spots for the most active monthly users, with the mobile version of Microsoft Office closing the top five.
In Russia, the leader in terms of the number of downloads per year is the shopping application AliExpress.
Following them are the service Zenly, which shows the location of friends, and the same CapCut.
Also in the top 10 are online karaoke app StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, Maps for Minecraft PE, online taxi service DiDi, YouTube Pure Tuber client, Dixi client and online marketplace Samokat.
People around the world have adapted to the pandemic by transitioning to a cash-based economy, which can be seen as one of the main takeaways.
The sectors that are doing the best are the ones that are helping people connect virtually and personally," said App Annie market research director Lysa Sidoo.
The mobile gaming sector's revenue reached $90 billion in 2021. Casual and hypercasual games, which have minimal or no storylines and minimal video content, were the most downloaded.
The top three most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the most popular games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends in the next year, analysts of the company named the growth of the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growth of the popularity of financial applications for the Z generation, for example, for investors Robinhood, and also the further increase in popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warn of new scam
Scammers have started looking for new ways to cheat in video messages.
This is reported by "Izvestia" with reference to experts.
According to the company Ivideon Director of Products Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is diphtheria.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings of the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the characteristics of the behaviour of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, perpetrators can call a friend of the victim via video call or create a video with a lookalike for the purpose of extortion.
Such frauds can easily trigger a phishing attack, as the fraudster can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios, said the expert.
Lead systems engineer Varonis Alexander Wetkol, for his part, noted that people tend to trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to technologies that use video.

Five steps to avoid type 2 diabetes
Problems with high blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
However, some don't think that's such a big deal, and they're right.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play the main role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to plain water positively affects metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar to dangerous levels when eaten in excess.
So the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying candy and keep it at home.
The appearance of the disease is influenced not only by improper nutrition, but also by habits.
In order to reduce the risk of developing diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Specialists recommend following a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help you lose weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in blood sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of cellulose.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the secretion of gastric juices and the increase of food absorption.

Dr Pavlova told of 'weekend hangovers' suffered by workaholics
Several factors can contribute to a decline in self-esteem over the weekend
A well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher of the Department of Fundamental Medicine of the Moscow University, scientific director of the Clinic of System Medicine Zukhra Pavlova told in her Telegram channel that the reason for the worsening of self-esteem after working days is often "the hangover of the weekend".
According to her, those who suffer most from this are workaholics, who in their free time experience headaches, dizziness and weakness.
Dr Pavlova noted that, in addition to the accumulated fatigue over a week, there were a lot of objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to the change in conditions.
Over the weekend our lives are transformed.
If you sleep for a long time, lie in bed all day, you are likely to eat more and drink less - the doctor argued. - As a result of the lack of coffee, there is a small crack.
Due to overeating and lack of water - the weight and the breakdown."
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you go to sleep three hours later than usual, you'll get a reaction known as jet lag.
It occurs in travellers crossing several time zones.
To determine which factor plays the decisive role in worsening self-esteem, Pavlova recommends tracking what changes the most on weekends.

Scientists in South Africa say Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine is not working
Pfizer's COVID-19 Vaccine Is Not Working in South Africa, Officials Say
Scientists in South Africa have conducted research and reported low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the Omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to the estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds (to the level) of the effectiveness of the vaccine in 22.5% against the infection with symptoms, therefore... it is doubted the ability of the vaccine to protect against the infection, - the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal says.
At the same time, specialists clarified that the drug can save people from a severe course of the disease.
Previously, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the Omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalization than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar in the usual products?
Sugar is not the best source of valuable nutrients.
His excessive diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should be aware that a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar in calorie content, makeup and glycemic index to sugar - may be listed under an unfamiliar word in a product's ingredients.
The label may list dozens of names that essentially mean sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
Other sweeteners that may be used include dextrose (sugar derived from corn), lactose (milk sugar), maltodextrin, agave syrup, and so on.
These are all simple sugars, which are mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, canned meat, bread and so on.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as to pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but whatever you call the ingredient - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it's still sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits and other products originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
As a result, the total sugar content may be significantly higher than stated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for Germany within 25 years
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the importance of importing gas for Germany is decreasing as the country continues to transition to a decarbonized economy.
According to his words, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045 and become a climate-neutral country.
In other words, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role, the Chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to the fact that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas, and will continue to do so in the future, as this resource is currently important for the energy transition.
He reminded that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was fixed.
Earlier, the head of the German Foreign Ministry, Annalena Berbok, said that the process of certifying the gas pipeline "Nord Stream - 2" is continuing.
According to the minister, within the framework of coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also stated that the pipeline "does not meet the requirements" of the EU.

Hackers breach Twitter prime minister of India
Hackers have breached the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The perpetrators managed to publish fake news.
It was reported that India supposedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal payment method and also that the country had already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office asked to ignore new messages.
Representatives for the premier said that Twitter quickly responded - access to the account was restored.
The Indian premier page was hacked in 2020 and called for donations to be made via cryptocurrency.
Voters in New Caledonia reject independence in referendum
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on December 12 ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at midday, the majority of New Caledonia's residents voted against independence in the referendum.
The level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favour of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
Turnout was 43.90 percent, with more than 80,000 people casting ballots in the election in New Caledonia.
As the French press agency France-Presse commented on these intermediate results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt", as supporters of independence called on voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago prevented holding a full-fledged and "fair" pre-election campaign.
This abstention opened the way to a third victory for the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, and in 2020, 53.3% did.
The separatists say they don't recognize the results of the last vote and are challenging them in the U.N.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, in the ElysÃ©e Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron will address the outcome of this referendum.
The issue of independence for New Caledonia has been a major theme of the French presidential campaign in recent weeks.
Several presidential candidates have expressed support for the territory to remain part of France, as it is "the last region of European Union presence in the Pacific".
New Caledonia must remain French, he reiterated.
Such a statement was made by the Republican candidate, Valerie Pecresse, who published an article in Le Figaro at the end of October, calling on the Caldoonians to remain French.
On his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position, "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, for his part, expressed "a strong desire for the choice of the Caledonians to be a choice of France".
Sveta, oh, hello!

WSJ Readers Criticize Article on Russia and U.S. Relations

The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger emanating from Moscow and made a number of insulting statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end of Hartwell called on Western countries to "stand as one against Russia".

Magnitude 5.2 quake hits Kuril Islands
A 5.2 magnitude earthquake has struck near the Kuril Islands of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The epicenter was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier seismologists recorded a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new generation unmanned aerial vehicles
The new Ukrainian-Turkish factory will begin to create unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was reported on December 11 by the presidential adviser Alexei Arestovich.
In other words, they are capable of acting against aerial objects, other unmanned aerial vehicles.
Even against aircraft piloted.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the fuselage and so on," he quoted him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA aircraft, Arestovich said that it was a jet aircraft, not a piston aircraft.
According to him, this new generation of unmanned aerial vehicles surpasses the Bayraktar in all respects.
The first batch of drones is expected to be produced by the factory at the end of next year, Arestovich said.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Space Agency in February 2014.
Development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in collaboration with a number of private companies since 2010.
Prior to this, the Ukrainian General Staff had classified data on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles Bayraktar and missile complexes Javelin during military operations by the joint forces in Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that construction of a factory to manufacture modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, where personnel will be trained, as well as tests and maintenance of Turkish drones Bayraktar.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the given memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escape from container at airport
Lions on the loose at Singapore's Changi Airport
This was reported by The Straits Times.
The two hunters managed to get out of the container with the seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it is unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions rested on the roof of the container.
The animals couldn't get away because there was a protective fence nearby.
The stand-off ended after the arrival of staff from Mandai Wildlife Group, the operator of all Singapore zoos, at the airport.
They tranquilized the lions using dart guns and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a leopard escaped from its owner and wandered the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and no one was injured.
Experts warn of cancer threat from vitamin B9
Studies suggest that excessive intake of Vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not suffer from a lack of folic acid are at a lower risk of developing certain types of cancer, including colon cancer.
However, exceeding the necessary dose is on the contrary conducive to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and dietician Beth Kitschen advises keeping an eye on the amount of folic acid you consume in a day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms a day.
The risk of cancer only increases if this figure is significantly higher or lower.
Kitschen recommends not taking Vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, monitoring dosage, and avoiding asparagus, spinach, and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutritionist Rachel Fein called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it's in avocados, among other things, Fein recommends men over 50 eat more of this fruit.
In the UK, around 75,000 people may die from coronavirus by April
British scientists predict that due to the spread of the Omicron strain of coronavirus in the next five months, up to 75,000 people may die in England if the restrictive measures are not tightened in the winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), according to TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists, who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergencies in the UK government, by April 2022, the country will have at least 25,000 fatal outcomes due to the Omicron strain, and around 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the epidemic, the hospital will receive more than 2,000 infected people daily.
Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to avoid overburdening the NHS if the Omicron strain proves more contagious than the Delta variant, and current vaccines do not prevent infection, said mathematician Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK's Health Security Agency informed that if the spread rate of the Omicron strain remains at the current level, around 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the Omicron variant is expected to become the dominant strain in the UK.
So far in the UK there have been 1,898 confirmed cases of the Omicron strain of coronavirus, of which 633 were confirmed in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, said that in reality this figure could already be 10,000 cases.
Wanted to write a smart comment, but read up to this point:
Shub, resulting from the unbearable sufferings of the unfortunate animal and its re-employment on a second job.

Global demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking world records, despite calls to reduce carbon footprints and tackle climate change.
In the global register of ships, the number of yachts ordered amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In the era of fighting climate change's consequences to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people with the desire and the money to buy a floating fortress for $50 million or more will not increase, writes the Guardian.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say there hasn't been this kind of frenzy in the market in 20 years.
The first reason is that many people who can afford a yacht are worried about getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on their own vessel.
The second reason is also linked to the coronavirus.
If before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted via Zoom.
Broker Will Cristie told the paper that the shipyard is taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that buyers are prepared to pay more just to get their yacht a year or two earlier.
People just want freedom, and the super-rich can afford it, he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior among the wealthy and call it decadent.
Wealthy people, according to sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of travel to space, life on yachts or flights on their own planes, society is irritated because the elite does not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are urging governments to act and are proposing new taxes and rules for the super-wealthy, even though they know it will be extremely difficult to enforce.
Meanwhile, the number of super-yachts ordered is impressive, but so are their specifications.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a length of the keel over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire, Rekke, is building a yacht, REV Ocean, measuring 183 metres in length.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a "moon pool", as well as an underwater submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
Decks on existing superyachts have become as common as helipads, outdoor cinemas and, on some, a fighting platform like the one on Gregor McGregor's yacht.Richard Wilkinson, professor of economic anthropology at the University of Indiana, says the carbon footprint of the super-rich is negligible by comparison to the total emissions of greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide.
But it is symbolic if you consider that there are only about 2000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the over-indulgence of a very small group of people.
Scientists found that the emissions footprint of billionaires is 1000 times higher than the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
Meanwhile, two-thirds of his emissions footprint can be traced to his 162.5-metre yacht, Eclipse.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to bring the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners aren't exactly endearing themselves to the rest of us when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns the continent's largest coal mines, complain via YouTube that there's nowhere to dock their giant ships.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships measuring 50 metres.
Deadly week's worth of alcohol linked to bowel cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express publication.
Experts have concluded that drinking four or more drinks a week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
However, the likelihood of developing the condition increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
In addition, the risk of developing colorectal cancer is higher among moderate drinkers than among women.
Scientists cannot pinpoint the exact cause of this type of cancer, but note that certain factors lead to a detrimental process in the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at two-year-old level
Many, if not all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they don't realise just how developed the four-legged offspring are.
For many years, biologists have been conducting various experiments to find out how animals develop intelligence.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can respond to 89 words or phrases in sequence.
The work was published in the journal ScienceAlert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, have no meaning in politics, economics or art, yet they often outwit their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding human speech, but there is not enough statistical data for precise conclusions.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered to be canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and are just as capable of learning as a two-year-old child.

Prepare for trade with the US and Russia in Ukraine
The United States and Russia will "negotiate" over Ukraine's inclusion in NATO, analyst Alexander Kots said in an article for the "Glavred" publication.
According to him, Washington and Moscow are planning to continue negotiations in the near future on the guarantees of the United States regarding Ukraine's non-entry into NATO, despite the words of US leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "enter wherever they want".
If you're offered something obviously unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you don't negotiate, you just say no and walk away.
There are plans for trade with Ukraine," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia is not planning to attack Ukraine, but is striving for dialogue with Kiev.
Preparations are carried out secretly, quickly and immediately switch to offensive actions, instead of waiting until the grouping is detected and forces of resistance are deployed, he noted.
China stimulates the development of the railway transport industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Exhibition of Rail Transit and Equipment Production, held in the city of Chuzhou in the province of Hunan / Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. enable trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said Hou Zhaowen, a company representative.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway, which began operations earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and operational efficiency of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its exports of railway transport equipment, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd sent the first two-story high-speed electric train developed in China to Europe for export.
At a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on railways in Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the experimental operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the centre of Istanbul to the city's airport.
The line will open next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey, with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
The Chinese equipment manufacturing industry for railway transportation is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovative competitiveness, said Fan Yaoyan, head of the Trade and Investment Department of the China Committee for the Development of International Trade /KCSDITM/.
This sector is the main source of competitive advantage for Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market, said Fan Yaoyan.
After more than 60 years of intensive work, China has created a leading system for producing railway equipment, with a full range of supporting facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yosian, the country ranks first in terms of the level of electrification of railways and the operational mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences, Semyon Goloshchin, in an interview with the radio Sputnik, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a whole range of mild cognitive impairments, such as difficulty concentrating, planning, and reduced abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a debate about whether hearing loss can be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease or one of the risk factors for its occurrence, said a specialist.
Goloshchuk emphasized that the causes of dementia may be neurodegenerative disorders, head trauma, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and vitamin deficiencies.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of cerebral vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective methods of treating dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in a timely manner.
He said learning a foreign language and keeping mentally active can help reduce the risk of dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking.
There are recommendations for the use of various medications, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being debated in the scientific community, Golyashkin said.
The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking, - said Goloshchin.
The Alzheimer's Society in the UK previously stated that the disease is increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors identify early symptoms of Alzheimer's
The first warning sign can be problems with vision, which make it difficult for the patient to recognise objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is aphasia - the inability to find the right words to express what you want to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychotherapy and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of a panel of doctors set up by Georgia's ombudsman, told journalists.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, and character instability, - the expert said, noting that this does not go beyond the norm and now the former president needs to be sent for special rehabilitation.
We call this neurorehabilitation and psychoneurological rehabilitation, which is not available in Georgia, - noted Toidze, who demanded that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
In the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage the receipt of medical assistance after the staff of the penitentiary service imposed disciplinary punishment on him.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to overturn the punishment and regain his former rights.

COVID-19 Passports Spark Protests in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, there were protests against compulsory certification of vaccination against COVID-19, according to the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, around 3,000 people took part in the action.
COVID-19 masks have become mandatory in bars, restaurants, sports halls, retirement homes and nightclubs in Barcelona.
Many of the demonstrators came without masks.
Slogans on their posters accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for citizens' choices.
Passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with more than 50 seats in Valencia.
Protesters in the city have called it a medical dictatorship, vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified since the beginning of the pandemic, and over 88,000 patients have died.
Russia also plans to impose restrictions on non-vaccinated individuals.
The government submitted the bills on the unified QR-code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places where mass events are held, cultural institutions, objects of public catering and retail trade with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a disease, or a medical record of vaccination.
Such rules will also apply to travel by train and plane.

Steep slope: How Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create resorts of international level in the country
In China, they hope that the Olympics will not only attract 30 million citizens to participate in winter sports, which will help collect the 1 trillion yuan that President Xi Jinping mentioned, but also promote the economic development of backward and remote areas.
The ski resort of Taivu in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among the Chinese.
In addition to building infrastructure in the region, tree planting is also carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are big enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, including Zhangjiakou, where the resorts are located, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long-term perspective is to ensure comfortable and interesting rest in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, there is still a long way to go.
IOC consultant Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed dramatically since his last visit in 2007.
Every winter, more and more Chinese people flock to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the serious changes, it will take many years to create a ski culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
70-year-old Gao Macong lives in Chunli, close to the site of the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism here.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, and now not a single local resident is unemployed.
More and more shops are opening in the country selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
Food stalls selling national cuisine are opened on the slopes.
There is now a COVID-19 testing station at Tayvo.
China is striving to create a thriving industry in winter sports, its athletes must become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment must reach world standards.
More than 500 million people worldwide could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people worldwide could be plunged into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled progress towards universal healthcare, the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage on December 12, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
In them they noted that the pandemic has led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and has caused excessive tension in the healthcare system.
As a result, for the first time in 10 years, the coverage of the population with immunization decreased, and the mortality rate from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
The WHO and the World Bank both stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so people are finding it harder to pay for treatment."
This situation is pushing more than 500 million people into "extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket".
In October, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres stated that the COVID-19 pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into destitution, and more than four billion people have almost no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister disinvited from "Democracy Summit" at White House request
Taiwan's Digital Minister Audrey Tang's speech at a panel discussion during the US-organized "Democracy Summit" was translated into an audio-only mode, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, said the picture was removed at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was marked in a different color from China, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries based on the degree of civil rights protection.
Taiwan was colored green as "free" while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were colored red as "closed".
After the minister had shown the map, the picture on her side was replaced by a screenshot with the comment that the opinions expressed by the participants of the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Democracy Summit".
Reuters sources note that the map the Taiwanese minister showed could be at odds with Washington's "one China" policy.
One source familiar with the matter told Reuters that after the map was shown to the U.S. National Security Council, the State Department became "irate" and complained to the Department of Defense that it had shown Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Democracy Summit" was held from December 9 to 10, with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society organizations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" summit, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of the New York Times, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund, through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Federation Security Council, Yuri Averianov, stated that the summit was "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese."

Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater - bad people exist, and you may have a specific complaint about them...
but what about the number of children, their ages, the pension fund and so on?
Write that they are "scammers, did not return the money".
And how many and when they will have children is not your business, as long as they do not collect these children to hang on your neck.
If this is not the case, what right do you have to condemn them?
Perhaps it is only in education that...
Chosen (their own selves) parents impose their rules, openly trampling on what already exists.
And if this will concern other spheres of life, judicial proceedings and so on?
For them laws are not written.
And if the Pope does introduce his method of education and formation?
What a bad example for others.

China strengthens prevention and control of COVID-19 in cities where land ports are located
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular, which stipulates strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land ports are located, in order to further prevent the importation of infection from overseas.
According to the circular, people leaving those cities will have to provide a negative COVID-19 nucleotide test result obtained within 48 hours of their departure.
People arriving in cities with land border crossings must undergo at least one COVID-19 nucleotide test upon arrival.
According to the document, these requirements will be in force from the date when the corresponding administrative units at the provincial level determine and publish the zones of the specified cities until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land border checkpoints that meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told about the "sad outcome" in relations between Russia and the USA
Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Ryabkov assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington in an interview with "Izvestia".
He noted that the long path of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries began not yesterday.
There is a one-sided negative predictability, but as for some prospects for the improvement of relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion based on the long journey we've been on with this administration, with Trump, with Obama.
Problems started yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is that the US is trying to impose its approach on Russia on a number of issues.
The head of the MID added that he would not have dared to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not have expected Washington to change its position.
He explained that progress has not been observed in areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to issues of international security and hopes that signals will be heard and Americans will listen to reason.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the US.
Virologist warned of the danger of nasal vaccination against COVID outside hospitals
People who have developed an allergic reaction to the COVID-19 nasal vaccine may need medical assistance, so the first points for administering this vaccine should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of biotechnology, microbiology and virology at the Novosibirsk State University, Sergei Netesov.
It's easier to set up points of vaccination in airports and shopping centres, but I would have done this at the start only in medical establishments.
The point is that the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but it is desirable for a person to stay in the doctor's office after this.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergy drugs that work literally within a minute-and-a-half, which is sometimes very necessary, said Nesterov.
In the opinion of a virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centres when there is experience of using the drug.
He also stressed the importance of getting the nasal spray vaccine to the mucosa in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a possibility that the vaccine may not reach its intended destination if the nose is congested when the vaccine is administered.

In the UK, 1,239 cases of the Omicron strain of coronavirus were registered per day - RT Ð½Ð° ÑÑÑÑÐºÐ¾Ð¼
In the UK, 1,239 new cases of the Omicron strain of coronavirus were identified in a day.
This was reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the Omicron strain were recorded in England, 38 people were diagnosed with a new variant of the infection in Scotland and five - in Northern Ireland.
The total number of people infected with the new strain of COVID-19 in the UK has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine made a pessimistic forecast, estimating that by April in England due to the outbreak of the "omicron" strain of the coronavirus, up to 75,000 people may die.
Peskov warned of suffering for western countries imposing anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including the alleged "invasion" on the territory of the country.
It is impossible to introduce some limitations against Russia and not suffer ourselves - the official representative of the Kremlin said on the air of the channel "Russia 1".
Peskov says that is "common knowledge".
Earlier it was reported that the US is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the EU plan to introduce restrictions aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Greff, is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonia residents reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on independence in New Caledonia, a clear majority of participants rejected secession from France.
This was reported by the French channel BFM.TV on December 12.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of the archipelago's population in the south Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
Turnout was very low on this day with around 55% of the islands population turning out to vote.
Low turnout was blamed on calls by separatists for a boycott of the referendum over the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
A referendum on independence was already held in the region in 2018.
The majority of residents supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has been granted special administrative and territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonia administration that allows the region to hold two referendums on independence every two years.

WHO preliminarily considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that "omicron" is less dangerous than the Delta variant of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there are data on the decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines against the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information as of December 9, "Omicron" has been registered in 63 countries.
Preliminary data and significantly altered antigen profiles of the "omicron" strain suggest a reduced effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
Based on preliminary findings from South Africa, it is suggested that it may be less severe than deltamethrin," said a WHO technical document.
The organisation notes that while all registered cases of "microcephaly" in the EU are currently mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, according to preliminary data, the new strain is spreading faster than "delts".
Two cases of infection with the Omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They had been "previously immunized," the Gamalei Center reported.
The head of Russia's consumer protection service, Anna Popova, said there was no reliable data to suggest the new coronavirus variant was less dangerous than others.

Four Scenarios for Zelensky in Ukraine
Former Ukrainian parliament member Vadim Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for President Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state may remain without support from the West, and may also make concessions on the Donbass.
This was reported by Denisenko on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the "Glavred" portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called the "ideal storm," envisages that Ukraine will cease to be supported by key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
At the same time, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and opposition to the authorities with key FPG (financial-industrial groups. - Red.), - the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the development of the situation - "war against everyone".
This forecast will come true in case of high turbulence in world politics, when Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
As a result of this situation, the Ukrainian leadership may compromise on the Donbass, which could lead to internal opposition.
At the end of summer, Zelinsky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation is 50-55%, according to the former MP.
The third scenario for the development of the Ukrainian political situation is opposition to the Zelinsky group of the population and the president, which leads to the capture of control over the power block and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
During such a crisis, Zelinsky will begin "restructuring power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario - the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
Something may happen that will be a huge shock to society.
The event should be of sufficient scale to attract the attention of external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine, Denisenko said.
Such a development is possible as a result of a natural disaster, technogenic catastrophe or aggressive actions by Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of "attacking" Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was noted that Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
This is his lowest approval rating since taking office.
Analysts predicted a situation where, in the event of the upcoming presidential election in Ukraine, Zelensky would receive only 21.8% of the vote, while ex-president Petro Poroshenko would receive 14.5%.
At the same time, only 19.3% of all respondents expressed support for the president.

Thank you for the story about the great athlete, did not know that Elena Shushunova died, very sad to learn this.
I remember how she was sick at the Olympics in Seoul, for us residents of Primorye it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such passions, emotions, I remember the joy when Elena won.
They were also happy about the other victories, as they had been rooting for Salnikov, for the footballers, for all Soviet sportsmen at the time.
On TV I saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries and they were loading the arrows onto the ship like barrels.

Poet arrested for Red Square action: "Give me 10 days for this quotation from Evtushenko, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student from the Higher School of Economics was detained on Red Square with a placard bearing the hashtag #Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÑÑÐ¾ÑÑÐ¸Ð±Ð¾Ð»ÑÑÐµÑÐµÐ¼Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑ.
This quote is attributed to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up on administrative charges of repeated violations of the order of holding a public event.
He was detained for the first time on January 23 on the Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
The aim was to attract attention to poetry as a whole, now, unfortunately, interest in it has been lost, and there is little hope of inspiring unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag, Alexander explains.
We contacted the young poet to inquire about the circumstances of his detention and to get more details about the message in his poem.
How were you addressed by police officers during your detention this time and previously?
What were they asking in the department, how were they commenting on your action?
This time the staff were more polite, detaining him for the maximum time, politely, as if it was some sort of joke.
The riot police (OMON) and riot officers (MOB) took to the streets.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked if not approving, then understanding.
Except for the drumming on all four sides of the monkey cage, everything was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was doing.
And if after the action under this hashtag will begin to write their poems, even a few people, I will not have wasted these 10 days.
Maxim, according to the protocol, you can talk to him alone in the language of the Tumbala-Yumba tribe.
At public and official events, the language used is that of the surrounding area, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on 25 September 2001, or in their own language via an interpreter.
This protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks Russian very well and still uses a translator.
And even at official events a stenotype is used, and the stenographer does not have to know several languages.
If you don't want to say much, just say no!

Researchers reveal how potatoes can help combat age-related decline
Studies have shown that potatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals that help improve circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
Root contains vitamins of the B group, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.
All of these elements help the body's systems function.
In addition, potatoes help combat age-related problems.
Thanks to its high content of catechins, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and regular consumption may also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for maximum benefit, root vegetables are best mashed or boiled rather than fried in oil.
Earlier this year, The Daily Express warned that carrots could be dangerous for diabetics, along with other high-glycemic index foods.

Candidates for eviction
In 2015, copyright holders in the "RAEC/Media" cluster compiled a list of the top 100 largest pirate sites on the Internet, and the majority of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, Director of the Internet Research Institute.
However, some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - managed to survive thanks to regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "The Witcher" and "Delicate" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest Russian video service Ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available through search engines, you can watch the new animated film "Encanto", but, judging by the quality of the video, it is called a screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in a cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 Years Later" from the TNT channel (part of "Gazprom-Media") is available.

Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K wall sconce
A broad circle, surrounded by "molecules" of light, ensures maximum even and bright illumination of the space.
The "atomic" or "molecular" design, which reflects the natural and natural essence of each object, is still relevant and allows you to emphasize the accents in the interior.
One of the distinctive features of such lamps is their lightweight construction.
Thanks to the thin, almost invisible cords that can be adjusted in height, the impression is created that the lamps are floating in the air.
Metal golden fittings and matte-white miniature ceilings will easily complement any colour scheme, and the suspension lamps and table lamps presented in the collection will become a ready-made ensemble for lighting the living room, bedroom and vestibule.
Well, in taste and colour, what do you call it?
I really liked "Tarkhun", not the current one, of course.
Very tasty were the juices from tall glass cylinders.
Three spoonfuls of syrup - enough for me.
The two were very different.
Mattress Dimax Micro Ultima, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient in that it has two different softness surfaces - high hardness and slightly softer.
The composition of the product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively on the best side.
Springs: the block of independent springs "micro-kit" is located in the center of the model.
This means that the bed has 2000 springs, which work autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides the unique point-to-point customization.
The "Micropaket" is the most high-frequency spring block in the "Dimaks" range, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered a premium product.
Fillers: a combination of cork and natural latex is used on the top and bottom of the spring.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface is latex, the other is coconut oil.
Such a combination of fillers has long ceased to be a classic, as it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the core provides the right support for the spine, latex provides the surface that adapts to the body.
Sleeve: the model is supplied in an Aloe Vera knitted sleeve.
It can be made as a portable one or a stationary one according to the customer's request.
The overall height of the product is 27 cm, and the recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: warranty period - 3 years.
The mattress has all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
Orthopedic foam used in mattresses has a CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will look for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the "Actual Camera" reported on Sunday.
The goal of missions that will begin in five years is to assess the suitability of Venus clouds for life and then search for it.
For the project, Tartu scientists offered instruments for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Up until now, it was thought that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, were too acidic to support life, but it is likely that Venus was originally a planet similar to Earth.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus is expected to arrive.
Assuming that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to Earthly or different.
If very similar, it will be obvious that life on Earth did not begin on Earth.
If there is a difference, it may be more likely that life originated on Earth," said the head of the Estonian "Venus Life Finder" project, Mihkel Paju.

Metaverse will change the Russian business
The topic of metaverse became popular this autumn, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format for digital interaction between people.
Therefore, business in Russia, as well as throughout the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverse and subsequent monetization.
Metaverse should be considered as a continuation of existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in the context of the pandemic, as people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of businesses developing ecosystems and adapting their operating models to them.
The third - they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to a digital format.
Ania, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating properly, you don't want anything too greasy and harmful.
Of course, we will have a holiday feast and traditional honey and garlic sauce, but no one is forcing me to eat it all at once.
You can eat it by the spoonful, try it - and that's enough.
After all, there are ten working days ahead, so you can prepare any tasty and useful dishes.

British economist failed to give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022 because, in his opinion, such attempts will fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
An expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend may change.
The most important factor remains the pandemic of coronavirus, and in second place is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted he didn't know whether the rise in goods prices was temporary or not.
As the expert noted, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the era of endless monetary easing by central banks has come to an end" and it is time to return to relationships where interest rates will be correlated with expected rates of economic growth.
O'Neill noted that, in the context of the pandemic, continuing ultra-loose monetary policy could, in the view of some experts, lead to a new bout of inflation.
In addition, it is necessary to pay attention to the issues of productivity growth, as well as poverty reduction and climate change, summarized O'Neill.
Earlier, the head of the department of global research "Discovery Investments" Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar rate in 2022 remain, but the potential for growth will be less significant.
Shulgin included in the list of risks for the dollar course the monetary and credit policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices and concerns due to the pandemic of the coronavirus.
She was forced to agree.
But there is one thing that is pleasing: if you compare yourself with yourself, five years ago there were fewer containers.
Things are better now.
There is progress, but it's slow.
Another problem is that there are many ecological initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
Any eco-taxi that picks up rubbish from homes.
And the dumping ground for waste is used by marginals.
Few people take glass and metal there.

Russia gave car dealers around 4.5% of its GDP
According to statistics agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI), based on the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on buying new cars, which is 28% more than the same period last year.
To understand the scale - approximately the same amount (around 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In September of last year, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such a sum was equivalent to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020.
In the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is leading in terms of revenue.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for a total of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The growth in the Kia brand of Hyundai is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
In terms of market share, this brand and the increase in the average selling price of cars - for Hyundai, it increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the dynamics of the rise in prices was stronger only for Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales of Korean brands did not grow so significantly: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the European Business Association in Russia, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
Japanese Toyota closes the top three leaders in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
In second place is Mercedes-Benz with a turnover of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both the volume of sales (by 37%) and the average price of cars (almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
At the same time, Mercedes-Benz is seeing good growth in sales and average selling prices - more, for example, than at BMW - which is leading to an increase in financial liquidity, explained the head of NAPI, Tatiana Arabadzhi.
At the rate of growth in sales, fantastic figures are being demonstrated by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
The Russian Lada brand demonstrates medium-term growth dynamics in terms of income (plus 28%), and Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand over 10 months.
Companies in the automotive sector, whose sales in terms of the number of vehicles sold in 2021 decreased compared to the previous year, include Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and in minus - for 10 months Russians spent on off-road vehicles and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with supplies of automotive components and disruptions in production, which have affected the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" raised the price of Lada models seven times a year, the last price increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) took place at the end of November.
They regularly update their price lists for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volumes of the automobile market in Russia in monetary terms will continue to grow - besides the shortage of cars, inflation is also contributing to this, as well as the desire of car manufacturers to make up for past losses, experts believe.
Given the shortage of cars, I think that many car manufacturers have even managed to partly pass on to consumers the costs of previous periods that they could not include in the price of cars before.
According to VTB Capital analyst Vladimir Bespalov,
I think the auto manufacturers feel very good financially right now, supporting high margins of sales."
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of car prices observed in 2021, new car prices are growing faster than inflation, the expert explains.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and in terms of money, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the machines themselves, predicts Besspalov.
Growth in the ability to raise prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian automotive market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth rate of car prices slows down, car manufacturers will be able to earn their income from volumes, notes independent automotive consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Taking into account the increased demand and insufficient supply, now car manufacturers are striving to get the maximum profit from each sold car, notes Burgazliev.
Increased production of machinery is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia, the hysteria is fueled by the uncertainty of citizens about the future.
Against the backdrop of the current market situation, cars have turned out to be a good investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than the original price, experts note.
Biden says US military would come to Ukraine's aid in case of Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending American military to Ukraine in case of "invasion" of Russia.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
There were no such plans, - the head of the White House said in response to a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation in Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he emphasized that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to defend Ukraine in case of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops in a unilateral manner to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden said that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the US would deploy forces to NATO allies in Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
We're going to have to put more American and NATO forces on the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries to which we have a sacred obligation to defend from any aggression from Russia, Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, emphasized that Moscow has no intention of invading Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey to Kiev, as well as the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
