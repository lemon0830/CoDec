Zhejiang University Academic Annual Conference: Students sing the leading role, research results make people’s jaws drop
A series of groundbreaking academic achievements were recognized at the opening ceremony of the 2016 academic year of Zhejiang University last night.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, and the research covers major areas such as the environment, mechanics, energy, medicine, life sciences, humanities education, etc. From a curious point, classmates have created many high-end inventions with practical value, some of which have won domestic and international awards.
Biosensors: Your family GP
Zhang Dianming, a doctoral student in the School of Biomedical Engineering, demonstrated a biological sensor at the smartphone size on the spot.
All you need to do is breathe a little bit, and this device can detect your health status based on the gas components you exhale.
Zhang Dianming introduced that this set of sensors is connected to the smartphone. When the gas is detected, the health report will be displayed on the smartphone.
Smart wristbands that can detect health conditions in the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensors uses a new type of material called stone varnish. Its target is chemical elements. Its sensitive "nose" allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the body's health status.
Smart surgical light: doctor's high-energy eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart surgical lights are also used in the operating room.
This invention won the silver award at the 44th Swiss International Invention Show in Geneva this year.
Zhu Linjing, a graduate student in the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, and the team of Shen Junfeng began to explore new ideas in the defects of traditional surgical lights and invented the smart LED surgical light.
Many illnesses are detected and removed at an early stage, which is related to the lights in the doctor's operating room.
Shen Junfeng said, for example, in cancer early detection, if the doctor cannot timely identify all the tumor tissue, then the cancer cells will spread.
This smart surgical lamp has four light plates, which can enhance the difference degree of different tissues under light irradiation by adjusting the spectrum.
During surgery, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity, and transparency of the light according to the surgical needs and personal habits.
This type of smart surgical light has been tested in hospitals such as Zhengzhou University Medical College Affiliated Siefang Hospital and Zhengzhou University Medical College Affiliated Children's Hospital, and has received good feedback.
In October last year, this invention won the first prize in the national challenge cup.
Use air to wash hands: Save water and cool off
Ordinary people wash their hands by splashing water, rubbing with soap, squeezing hand sanitizer, while Li Quizhang and his classmates invented a set of "air washing device".
As long as we stand on the washing machine, our weight can compress the air out.
It's like a balloon.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the nozzle and combines with the water.
So we can wash our hands clean!"
Visible reaction and bacterial residue experiments prove: The effect of this method of washing hands is the same as the ordinary washing method.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force. It can ensure the cleaning degree and save 90% of water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmentally friendly.
Last year, at the second Global Grand Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among many top universities in the world and won the only gold award.

A meaningful certificate - an emergency certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates in addition to my driver's license!
Brief translation: Emergency measures are actually emergency rescue in the event of sudden incidents, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives.
It is well known that in the process of rescue vehicles arriving after an accident, there is actually a period of time, and this period is actually the most critical.
This was an emergency.
If I really had a heart attack, a brain hemorrhage, stop breathing, then our life window is four minutes, golden four minutes!
So the people around me know how important first aid is!
When someone close to us falls down, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue him, instead of standing there doing nothing and feeling helpless.
In China, our official data shows that 3 million people die of sudden death every year, and the most dangerous one is heart attack.
The national average is 15 percent.
In a casino hotel in Las Vegas, 78% can be saved, and in Shanghai and Beijing, it is less than 1%.
This is what Lu Lei, the founder of the first response said.
If someone's heart stops, they're not breathing, they're not breathing, there's nothing you can do.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions may be necessary to save a life.
I found that nowadays, few people have this awareness to learn first aid, but when the emergency occurs, it is too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can make timely response when facing emergency situations.
Saying "I don't know" can save someone's life!
Emergency certification can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students can also enjoy preferential policies.
P.S.: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before the age of 25. Adding the emergency card to the list of goals was something that happened a few months ago, but it was definitely accomplished!
Next, I will apply for other certificates that I am interested in. I plan to apply for a scuba diving certificate. I saw a scuba diving emergency certificate on Xiaohongshu before, and it seems that I need to have an emergency certificate to take the scuba diving certificate. So, an emergency certificate is actually very useful!

In conclusion, I personally believe that "The Four Seasons" is a comprehensive film that covers all aspects.
But you say this movie is not a bright spot, and it is not a good choice at least.
There are so many kinds of movies that can make you fall asleep in the cinema, and so many that can make you feel angry after watching. For the audience, “4 Horsemen” is like a monkey on Mount Everest, it can use countless ways to ignite your anger.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han really is a genius.
The most painful thing about this movie is that it seems to be a creature from the Cixi novel, difficult to name, and full of holes like the wind jacket on Xiao Ma Gao.
Even after watching it, you may doubt whether there is a hidden metaphor in it, but when you think about it carefully, you will find that it is actually a pile of dung.
To put it simply, there are some plot points that I find difficult to understand.
The male protagonist should reside on a small island in the south with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see the snow, so the plot arranged for a grandfather in the neighborhood to drive her to Northeast China to see the snow.
Do elderly people in wheelchairs watch snow from the south to the northeast?
He and his dad are very relaxed about it.
Then the old man just disappeared.
How did the female protagonist's boyfriend get a business license to open a bar on a derelict boat?
Why did the Flying Island Party's little troublemaker make the mountain road a toll road with ease?
The train carrying steel rods then stopped at the side of the road, and the drivers of the surrounding lorries could not find it.
This thing is too obvious.
Why would a fly-by-night gang suspected of illegal activities become a deputy police officer?
In the face of high-interest loans, why did he not report to the police? In the movie, the police even asked him whether there was any difficulty.
An adult knows how to use a smartphone but doesn't know how to use a room key at the hotel, so they forced to arrange to find the hotel manager and sleep outside the room.
This inexplicable plot fills the entire film, and because the plot is too absurd, I remember them and feel painful.
Besides the plot, the worst thing about the movie is its theme, or to say, this movie has no theme at all, it's just a ridiculous patchwork.
At the beginning of the movie, you may think it is a comedy. More than 20 minutes later, you may think it is an inspirational movie. At the halfway point, you may think it is a movie that depicts the hard life of young people in a small town. After watching the movie, you will have deep doubts about why you went to the cinema to enjoy yourself.
For most people, it is very familiar with the plot of various movies. For example, if you want to shoot a movie about a taxi driver, you can use inspiration + comedy to tell the audience a talented chicken is how to gradually move towards success.
If you want to shoot a love story, then you should talk about the grudge between the young man of the town who loves to ride a motorbike and the server girl.
If you want to reflect reality, then your plot must not contain anything contrary to the normal world.
(For example, the new Mustang played by Yin Zheng, who can sing after being burned, can’t help but think of some unforgettable brain drain.)
As for the female lead, she may not be very intelligent, but she can act like a 5-year-old in some aspects. I don’t know whether this is due to her acting skills or the director’s request.
There is also something I don't understand. Why is Han Cun so fond of adding car chase scenes to his own movies?
Is this kind of arrangement in the Spring Festival edition for the benefit of the audience?

Inspection of the production and processing equipment for the precast concrete module of the shale gas drilling rig in Zhengzhou:
Yichun inspected the equipment of the brick machine for the new type of brick used in underground construction of coal, heat, water, electricity and gas.
For example, various types of inspection wells for drainage, water supply facilities, rainwater outlets, manholes, septic tanks, and small-scale buildings, bridges, and retaining walls.
The advantage of using prefabricated concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the modules have a stepped structure on the top, bottom, left and right sides, forming a chain lock when assembled.
The reinforced masonry wall is far superior to the rammed earth form of construction.
The module is a hollow structure. After assembly, the vertical and horizontal pores are connected, and the pores are consistent in the horizontal direction. After the porous ceramic is impregnated, a current-like structure is formed, which provides secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The module is horizontally and vertically provided with screw holes, and the horizontal and vertical screws correspondingly increase the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells drilled from the inspection module made of cemented soil are prone to collapsing, sinking, and leakage.

The intelligent control equipment of the concrete inspection drilling module brick machine is equipped with data input and output devices, and can touch-screen monitor the entire process of mechanical operation. It realizes ideal human-machine dialogue, automatic analysis of raw materials, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
The hydraulic system of the caisson wall module uses single-tube hydraulic pressure and delivery, and double-tube hydraulic pressure and delivery.
An independent hydraulic integrated station avoids the impact of main machine vibration on the hydraulic system, thereby ensuring the reliability of the hydraulic system.
The brick machine equipment for the inspection module of the cement mixer advances, the hopper door is closed, the automatic conveyor is provided, and the entire process is independently completed by the hydraulic system to reduce mechanical wear and maintenance.
The concrete inspection drill module equipment adopts imported computers and appliances, sealed components, hydraulic seals, and ensures the overall performance and reliability of the equipment.
The vibration platform of the tunnel lining module uses a steel plate as a whole, and there is no welding point on the cutting line of the table, so that the filler box can swing freely and reduce mechanical wear.
Reduce the load on the mold, combine the filler and encryption amplitude, adopt integration and full synchronization, vibration of the table, vibration of the mold, to ensure that the vibration effect is achieved.
The vibration motor and computer automatic control vibration amplitude adjusts the vibration amplitude according to the material cost ratio, no wear and tear, thereby extending the service life and reducing costs.
The wall body module has dual functions of automatic control and manual control.

Chongqing Municipal Vocational College Pilot the Modernization of Student Body System, Entrance is Employees of Enterprises-Chinanews.com
Yesterday, reporters learned from the city’s Education Committee that this year, our city will pilot the “modern apprenticeship” personnel training model in 60 middle schools. Students who are accepted for pilot training will have the status of apprentices and will be pre-registered as employees by the pilot enterprise after enrollment.
The city education commission requires standardizing the recruitment and employment procedures of vocational colleges and enterprises, clearly defining the dual identity of students in vocational colleges and employees of enterprises, signing a three-party agreement between students, schools, and enterprises according to the principle of mutual selection, and signing a four-party agreement between students, guardians, schools, and enterprises for students under 18 years of age, to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific position, teaching content, and safeguards of the training position of the student.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship forms and cooperate with enterprises to jointly carry out pre-employment training and transfer training for enterprise employees.
The pilot schools will reform the talent training mode.
The school and enterprise jointly designed a talent cultivation program, jointly formulated professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, position standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot period for the curriculum reform is set as a trial cycle. Students determine their internship time according to the talent cultivation plan of the enterprise during their internship. Top internships usually last for six months.
In the practice of enterprises, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one teacher can bring 2 to 5 disciples to form a study group to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city divided into three batches to determine 60 pilot modern apprentices at the city level. The number of each batch is about 50, and a total of 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of exploring and establishing a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integration of sports talents, we will gradually promote the exploration and establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integration of sports talents, gradually improve students’ employability and employment quality.

South African doctors: Ebola transmission strong but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the new variant of COVID-19 are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although the spread rate is faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the variant of COVID-19 spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that they are currently treating patients with mild symptoms similar to those of the flu, such as body aches and coughing.
Dr Unben Pillay, the organisation's chief executive, said he was seeing dozens of patients a day but there were no inpatients.
They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation, Peley said.
He said this includes the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions who are more vulnerable to severe illness from the virus.
He said compared with the previous outbreak, the new coronavirus patients he treated in the first wave had "difficulty breathing and low oxygen saturation.
A lot of people are going to be in hospital over the next few days."
Over the course of two weeks in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences following the first report of a mutated Ebola virus.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observation and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute of Communicable Diseases, in the past few weeks, only 30% of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized were severely ill, half of the proportion in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average length of hospitalization was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% died, while in the early cases in South Africa, the mortality rate was 20%.
Willem Hanekom, head of the Africa Health Research Institute, quoted data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports as saying: "Currently, all indications are that this is a mild disease."
He also said: "It's still early days, we need to get the late data.
Usually, the time between admission and death is later, but we are only two weeks into this wave of the epidemic."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, while also testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although the Delta variant remains the predominant new coronavirus strain worldwide, cases of the Omicron variant are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in the first week of December in the province increased by 400%, and tests showed that more than 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.

Education time: What do you rely on to save abducted children?
If we compare the famous public service advertisement slogan "No buying, no selling, no killing", then in a good environment with no "demand", group prevention and mass anti-trafficking make trafficking unprofitable, risky and expensive, so such crimes will not occur frequently.
Recently, the Criminal Investigation Department of the Ministry of Public Security launched an emergency platform for the missing children.
This is to establish an authoritative channel for the dissemination of information on missing children and an internet information platform for timely recovery of abducted children.
The app is called "Circles," and it's warm and fuzzy.
The new technological means are not only named “Literature” and full of sentiment, but also informationized application is proper and effective.
Combating kidnapping, the primary goal is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Second is the trial and punishment of the suspects.
The significance of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, can be listed as many "big words".
However, prior to the breakthrough in the trafficking case, the personal safety of the victim should be given priority.
In the face of urgent "rescue", topics such as "whether child trafficking should be punishable by death" and other controversial topics can be temporarily suspended and carefully discussed; but matters such as rescuing children cannot be temporarily suspended.
According to the experience of investigating such cases, human traffickers are accustomed to leaving the scene of the crime as soon as possible after the deed is done.
The search operation lasted for one minute, and the child may be one step away from his parents. The difficulty of the case investigation also increased by one minute.
In this case, taking direct action to help solve the case and find the child, such as using the "WeChat" platform, is indeed practical.
After all, "tackling corruption" is a big task that requires the entire legal system to work together.
Combating crime, safeguarding the rights and interests of children and parents, from the perfection of legislation to the safeguarding of the judiciary, as well as the clandestine operations of law enforcement, all require the implementation of "care for the young and weak".
In addition, the prevention of child trafficking, from the family to the society, can also be done better.
For example, a common case is that a family of three rests at the train station and only wakes up to find that their child is missing.
It is not reasonable to expect a two-year-old child to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of young children, at least a certain level of protective awareness should be possessed.
Both parents taking turns to rest and entrusting the child to the care of others is the most basic means of preventing child abuse.
From the perspective of the police cracking down on human trafficking, those who purchase children for adoption should also be concerned and punished.
Individual illegal acts are often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, the prescribed punishment for the crime of trafficking children is 5 years of imprisonment; in cases where the circumstances are particularly severe, the death penalty may be imposed, and property may be confiscated.
Punishment is severe at the beginning and heavy at the end. In the trend of “light punishment”, trafficking children is obviously a crime with severe punishment.
To this day, many trafficking cases still occur every year.
It is evident that some people have outdated views on raising children and weak legal awareness.
The legal education of these people should be carried out in parallel.
To effectively control drug trafficking, it is not enough to rely solely on strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the "market" is widespread and the sellers are eager to innovate, they will constantly create new ways of selling and form a "fighting" situation with the law enforcement officers. Such a situation will inevitably lead to inefficiency.
Therefore, breaking the backward mentality, popularizing legal norms, can also help to eradicate trafficking in children.

The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two main categories: virgin olive oil (Virgin Olive Oil) and refined olive oil (Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil), with five grades.
The first pressing of olive oil, also known as virgin olive oil, is obtained by mechanically cold-pressing fresh olives and removing impurities through filtration.
It can be divided into three levels according to the different pH values:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: is the highest quality and highest quality olive oil, it is a pure natural product.
The taste is excellent, with a delicate and refreshing plant fragrance, and the acidity does not exceed 1%.
Fine Virgin Olive Oil: slightly acidic, not exceeding 2%, with a pure and fragrant taste.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil (普通初榨橄榄油): flavor and aroma are still present, acidity does not exceed 3.3%.
Refined olive oil refers to the olive oil obtained after the initial distillation of olive oil with an acidity of over 3.3%, or becomes a "second oil".
Refining olive oil can be divided into two levels:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: A blend of refined olive oil and a certain proportion of virgin olive oil, mixed to balance flavor, color and acidity, with an acidity of less than 1.5% and a transparent light golden yellow color.
Refined olive pomace oil or olive pomace oil (Refined Olive-Pomace Oil): is obtained by extracting and refining olive oil from the residue.
If you look at the classification of grades, you should have found that the acidity of olive oil is a very important indicator.
To know, olive oil is like wine grapes that come from different regions and different olive varieties, will produce different standard olive oil.
Best place to grow olive oil:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable climate conditions for olive and oak growth, including soil, temperature, sunlight, humidity, and rainfall.
Apart from the Mediterranean coast, other regions can only cultivate zero-stars in their natural habitats.
Main production area (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, and other countries with similar climates also have far-southern latitudes such as Argentina, Peru, and South Africa.
Olive harvest season:
The months of 3 to 6 are when the olive tree blossoms and fruits, and the months of 7 to 10 are when the fruits begin to develop and mature, transitioning from green to red, purple, and finally black.
The period from November to February the next year is the fruit harvest season (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutritional Composition of Olive Oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid and linoleic acid, as well as vitamins A, B, D, E, K, and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered the most suitable fat for human nutrition among all the oils discovered so far.
Democratic National Convention ends, Biden says the torch of liberty will never go out
The online "Democracy Summit" attended by government leaders from 110 countries, as well as civil society and private sector leaders, was convened by U.S. President Biden on Friday (December 10).
In his closing statement, Biden said that the flame of liberty burns in the hearts of every person in the world, and authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish it.
He also said that the second global "Democracy Summit" will be held next year.
Taiwan government representatives, officials and Tang Fei, a Hong Kong democracy activist in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit on the second day.
We know how hard the work is that lies ahead, Biden said.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge because, as I said before, democracy is nowhere to be found.
"Authoritarian regimes will never be able to extinguish the flame of freedom, which burns in the hearts of people all over the world."
Biden also said that defending democracy requires the collective effort of the entire society.
He said, "As the leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the pillars of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent accountability, and better resist the forces of authoritarianism, as well as those who seek power at the expense of the public interest."
The themes for the second day of the "Democratic Summit" are defending human rights, consolidating democracy and opposing authoritarianism, as well as countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincided with "International Human Rights Day".
UN Secretary-General Guterres also said in his opening speech on the same day that democracy is facing challenges worldwide, especially the challenges brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said: "It's time to reiterate common values and positions as well as democratic resilience.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, updating social contracts, investing in quality education, and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires resolute condemnation of all forms of populism, nationalism, and extremism, including the use of all tools provided by the technological revolution.
Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong delivered a pre-recorded video message to the summit, reminding attendees to pay attention to the human rights situation of ethnic minorities such as the Chinese in Hong Kong and Tibet.
He said, "For a long time, the world has been receiving the rise of China, but it has not established a mechanism to hold it accountable.
This is why political figures and civil society leaders must collaborate.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure the revival of democracy is our top priority.
Rogge also called on the free world to unite to counter the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said: "Maybe some of your people are afraid of offending Xi Jinping, maybe some of your people don't want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of your people don't understand the threat of the Chinese Communist Party to our democratic values.
And that's why we lost.
This is also why we must change."
At the roundtable discussion entitled “Combating digital authoritarianism, affirming democratic values”, attended by the Executive Yuan’s Policy Research and Coordination Committee’s Tang Feng, the “National Declaration” was released via video, emphasizing Taiwan’s position at the forefront of the fight against authoritarianism and tyranny.
He also shared his experience on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building trust.
He said, "At the dawn of Taiwan's democracy, we have always been at the forefront of the global anti-totalitarianism movement, and have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights."
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world rationalized violations of human rights in the name of public health and collective interests, and global democracy has shown signs of decline.
However, in Taiwan, we don't have to close the city to control the epidemic, we don't have to suspend classes to fight fake news.
On the second day of the "Democratic Summit", the US Department of the Treasury announced the imposition of sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities from China, North Korea and other countries that have been identified as having severely violated human rights, while imposing investment restrictions on a Chinese company that has been identified as having used surveillance technology to assist in human rights violations.

Hello, the bottled water chicken at the restaurant is live
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid that I won't be able to stick to it, so I want to find a coach who is not too expensive first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to the degree of friendliness. If you can't distinguish, then the expensive normal situation will be more friendly than the cheap knock-off, which is actually industrial waste.
They are very low in strength, hit the knuckles, vibrate very much, and the hard ball is difficult to control.
Their rhetoric and subtext is - it's so difficult, you know you can't learn it, you can't afford it, they know you're cheap, they'll give you a bargain, you'll play it twice and you'll never play it again, this way it's cheap, you won't care.
Until you can tell the difference between good and bad, explain to me how you’ve progressed, then come back here and buy the expensive one, I’ll make twice the money.
Spend the same amount of money to buy a good second-hand racquet. Choose Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not well-known, so the good racquet is not worth the money. For a new racquet, 500-600 yuan is enough. For a second-hand racquet, 200 yuan is enough. Is enjoying a racquet worth thousands of yuan?
Be friendly to newbies, but once they pass the newbie phase, they're out of their depth, but most people, especially girls, never get past the newbie phase.

In fact, a lot of attention is paid to the clothing and accessories for girls who are slightly overweight.
Girls who are overweight should not wear dresses that are too short or too long. The length of the dress should not be much different from the knee, just enough to cover the area of ​​the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the legs.
It can make you feel short and fat.
If you divide the upper, middle and lower into three sections, you will naturally appear taller. This is because the upper garment, skirt and tights are different colors, which gives the appearance of height.
In fact, many deep-colored clothes are the uniforms of chubby girls (the author has a lot of experience). Deep-colored clothes are also a good way to hide your body fat, and elegant black shorts are the first choice of chubby girls.
Wearing dark clothes, especially a black skirt, will make you appear thinner.
If your ankles are too thick, your socks and shoes should not be too noticeable.
The larger the crowd, the better, and the colors should not be too bright.
In order to avoid people paying too much attention to your legs and feet, make people feel fat.
For the slightly plump girl, it is important to talk about the art of dressing well.
Don't wear a short skirt that hugs your body too tightly, and don't wear a top that's too short or rides up inside the skirt. This will make you look very uncomfortable. If your legs are too thick, wear a black knee-length skirt or a grid skirt (the kind with small squares). Choose a soft, flowy floral maxi skirt, pair it with a cropped top, and you can effectively cover up a plump girl's lack of curves.
Of course, plus-size children are also a concern when wearing shorts.
If you're a plus-size girl in a short skirt, opt for a top that matches the skirt's color for added height.
Wearing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the hottest combination for summer!
If you're plus-sized but have thin legs, opt for a bodycon dress.
Not only can it conceal large pores, but it can also showcase your best features.
A-line skirts will make you appear slimmer, so they are more suitable for plump girls. Choose a fitted top to create a layered effect, which will make you appear slimmer.
Wear a white T-shirt with a short skirt, even if you are plump.
Thin girls can also be stylish.
As long as they can grasp the rules of dressing, plump girls will also become the focus.
In terms of dressing and matching, there has been a change. In life, we must move more and strive to lose the label of being a "fat girl" as soon as possible.

Girl volunteers to be a target for her sister's fundraising campaign: "I'm fine even if I get hurt" - Xinhua
A girl in Hangzhou Wulong Square stood in front of a large wooden board with the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan, one arrow" written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of "Hangzhou girl Guan 'arrow' for recruiting donations" went viral on social media.
Photos show a girl standing in front of a large wooden board with the words "human target practice, 10 yuan per arrow" written on it in Hangzhou Wulong Square.
The incident triggered a heated debate among netizens.
Last night, the spokesperson of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau Sub-Branch confirmed to New Beijing News reporters that the police have confirmed that the girl is the sister of the donor. The police have confirmed that the girl made such an impulsive move because of her sister's donation. However, such behavior is not worthy of promotion. After being warned, the girl left the local office yesterday.
Girl 'arrow target' street fundraiser for accused
In an image circulating on the internet, a long-haired girl in the shape of the character "@" stands in front of a large wooden board on which the words "human flesh target, 10 yuan one arrow" are written in black ink. In front of her is another wooden board on which her bank account number and WeChat, Alipay and other accounts are written.
The picture caused controversy when it was posted online.
Some netizens believe that this move is a "shameless act" and many netizens expressed their sympathy.
We found the situation when we patrolled the square at around 10 am on the 23rd. At that time, the crowd was already quite large.
According to a report by local media, the two girls who were working at the stall were aged around 20 and dressed in youthful and beautiful attire.
In particular, the girl who played the "human target" was crying, asking passersby to play a game of "human target". Another girl was standing by the roadside, helping to drink, saying that her friend's sister had leukemia and urgently needed surgery fees.
We contacted local police and learned that the girl was soliciting donations for her sister's leukemia treatment.
Last night, the spokesperson of Hangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau sub-bureau told the reporter of New Beijing News that the girl whose name is Jia Jia Lily donated money for her sister Jia Yan.
However, due to the fact that the treatment still costs more than 300,000 yuan, they came up with the idea of fundraising.
He said that during the entire process, the two girls were the target and the one responsible for hitting the target, but did not participate in it. During the entire process, no one was found to have shot arrows, only people who surrounded and took photos and sent them to Weibo.
After the police were informed by the security department, it was identified that the bows and arrows used were not within the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "We do not advocate this way of fundraising."
After the local police warned her, she left the police station.

It's a very good purchase, and it's suitable for both men and women.

It's not bad, the graphics of the game is really beautiful.
What was the hottest thing in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympian athletes can win awards?
A few months ago, an article titled “Quick! Project Manager Can Win Gold Olympic Projects” was very popular. In the article, it was mentioned that in many projects, project managers can absolutely be in the vanguard and no one can catch up: moving bricks, going on business trips, staying up late are the daily routine of project managers, while firefighting, cooking, and apologizing are not even worth mentioning.
The article appears to be humorous, but it also reveals the daily struggles of project managers, which is a reflection of the current project management work.
People engaged in project management work also gradually choose to get rid of the difficulties in their work through some actions.
From the number of people who register for the PMP certification exam each year, more and more project managers are enhancing their project management skills through learning.
According to the “20th Anniversary Report on the Development of Project Management in China (1999-2019)”, as of September 2019, there were nearly 600,000 cumulative PMP® exam takers in China, with approximately 420,000 passing the PMP® certification exam, and around 300,000 effective certification holders, accounting for 31.2% of the global PMP® certification holders.
The number of PMP certified professionals has been increasing in recent years, indicating that more and more project managers are realizing that relying solely on "old experience" is no longer an option in today's rapidly changing work environment. We must learn to adapt and explore the path forward with the guidance of scientific giants.
However, after passing the PMP exam, can project management work be free and smooth?
Many project management beginners say that by studying PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically grasp the knowledge points related to the ten areas and five processes of project management, but they are still at a loss when it comes to actual project management work.
Many project managers often provide feedback on the following issues: project management knowledge is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, lack of project management theory, do not know how to practice; lack of systematic project management process and procedure support, work cannot be implemented, project estimation is not accurate, control sensitivity, project drags on and on; unclear division of labor among members, "old oil barrel" in the team does not know how to deal with cross-departmental communication difficulties, project progress is difficult to promote.
Therefore, the focus on product innovation and R&D management has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other R&D key talents, and has won the honorary title of “China’s Base for R&D Management Talent Training”. Tianhua Consulting, with its “R&D Project Manager Training” online course, came to help.
"Research and Development Project Manager Training Online Course" is an online fragmented learning method that combines numerous real-world case studies, tools, and methods from research and development enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions for project management, and move forward on your own project management journey.
This is also an opportunity for companies to use lower costs and less investment to promote the training process of project managers and bring high-efficiency operation results to the company.
You can ask other students for their opinions on the course: This course is not only taught by a team of experts from Zhongtian Huaxia, but also combines international cutting-edge project management methodologies and numerous well-known enterprise real business scenarios to provide a comprehensive and professional explanation of the course content.
In addition, it will provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as rich template forms to help students translate their learning content into practical work after class.

JD “Double 12” Pre-holiday Advocates Rational Consumption to Consumers
This year’s “Singles’ Day” online payment business transaction volume amounted to RMB1.77 trillion, setting a new record.
The abundance of red envelopes and the live broadcast of the shopping spree have again made consumers shout for joy and benefit. On the one hand, this consumption trend has made people admire the strength of national consumption. On the other hand, we must calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer group of today.
On the eve of the “Double Twelfth”, JD Financial Services Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “JD Financial”) issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the general public, especially young people, to establish good consumption consciousness and consumption habits, and to reject blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the "Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report" published by the People's Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, the performance of Chinese residents in the financial consumption sector is better, but there are significant differences in financial behavior and skills, and further improvement of basic financial knowledge is needed.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and young people is relatively low. “One-to-one” will still be a key focus of financial education. The “2019-2020 China Young Consumer Report” issued by Nielsen and the “2019-2020 China Young Consumer Credit Report” issued by CCTV-24 show that the young generation has tremendous consumption potential. Consumer spending is an important way for consumption upgrading, and 86.6% of young people use credit products. Nearly half of them have no debt accumulation.

Vietnam Net - Gulf Cooperation Council should respond to common challenges
Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is worth noting that this is the first visit of King Mohammed VI to Qatar since Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies imposed a blockade on Qatar in mid-2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt broke off diplomatic relations with Qatar and imposed a comprehensive embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist organizations and having close ties with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions have had a serious impact on the internal solidarity of the Gulf Cooperation Council and have had a negative impact on the economy of the region.
Four Arab countries have blocked the land and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only resolved at the January 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council summit, when the Gulf countries signed a US-Kuwaiti-mediated agreement towards "unity and stability".
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are working to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
The Gulf Arab countries resolved their differences to restore relations with Qatar, out of the need to unite for the interests of their countries and regional stability, aiming to address common challenges.
During the visit of Saudi King Salman to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land corridor between two Gulf countries.
The 725-kilometer-long channel connecting the two countries will provide convenient conditions for the travel of citizens of the two countries and the integration of supply chains.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia will invest $5 billion in Oman, and the two countries' companies have signed a memorandum of understanding worth $3 billion.
Saudi Crown Prince's visit to Gulf countries coincided with Iran's nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers aimed at rescuing the Iranian nuclear agreement - a deal that Gulf Arab countries criticized for failing to address Iran's missile program.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "competitor" and Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf countries believe that not resolving the Iran missile problem and not taking action to curb Iran's activities in the region are flawed.
In the context of the failure of nuclear negotiations between major powers and Iran, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted direct negotiations.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors that contribute to the slowdown of economic growth in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The upcoming summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council will be the first since the end of disputes between some member countries and Qatar.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to re-evaluate its diplomatic efforts to promote the restoration of the Gulf Cooperation Council as a unified entity, while proposing various measures to ensure full cooperation among its member states to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of Gulf countries.

Claimed to be the city with the loudest exhaust sound!
This time, our team brought the car that many men dream of!
It is the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini - the Aventador LP700-4!
With a price of nearly 20 million yuan, an annual road tax of several thousand yuan, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast 700 horses can go?
Even the editor does not know, according to the data, accelerating from 0 to 100km/h only takes 2.9 seconds, which is about the time it takes for myvi to accelerate from 30km/h to 100km/h.
The low-slung body, aggressive scissor-door, huge air intakes all around the car body and the glassy 6.5 V12 engine, perfectly interpreted the Lanbocini style.
There is no need to say too much about the specifications of the vehicle. As long as you Google it, you will find the answer. Here are some explanations that Google may not have given!
Too much attention, where everyone is looking, it's not comfortable! (It's actually quite enjoyable)
1km petrol costs about RM1 (car owners don't really care)
You have to practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise you'll feel a bit awkward (because you'll be stuck halfway in the trunk)
The engine is too loud, but it's still very pleasant.
The car is too big, and the parking space is very narrow. I am afraid to be hit by the door of the car in front of me when the driver opens the door!
A bit lonely, because there was no one on the road (laughs).
Don't be fooled folks, this video is not for sale, sorry!

Let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times resonate
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of academic concepts and values ​​formed over a long period in the development process of a university, which is the soul of the university.
Throughout history, the university spirit has been crucial to the development of politics, economy, culture, technology, society, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the world's first modern university, universities have shouldered a unique mission different from other social organizations. For our country's universities, which rose to prominence during a time of national crisis, their spirit has been deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changing times. They advocate the values of "righteousness and benefiting the world" and "strengthening the country through education" while taking on patriotic responsibilities.
Currently, the trends of informatization and internationalization in higher education are becoming increasingly apparent. The global competition in education, technology, and talent is continuously intensifying, and higher education, as an important “supply side”, is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges in its structural reforms.
In particular, the proposal of the overall plan for advancing the construction of world-class universities and disciplines has demonstrated the confidence and determination of our country in advancing from a major power in higher education to a major power in higher education. It has also set higher and more up-to-date requirements for the development of universities.
How can we strive to be among the world’s top universities in a relatively short period of time, accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and disciplines based on a certain gap, and achieve the “bend the curve”?
In addition to having a firm belief in their goals, path, and abilities, colleges and universities should also fully leverage three advantages: firstly, the advantage of lagging behind, by continuously introducing outstanding overseas scholars, learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, and achieving significant improvements in academic level and academic quality; secondly, the advantage of cultural superiority, inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over five thousand years, and promoting the development of excellent traditional culture, thereby consolidating strength, building brand, and enhancing image; thirdly, the advantage of institutional superiority, leveraging the superiority of socialist countries' systems, strengthening goal-orientedness, pooling consensus, optimizing resource allocation, and providing sustainable and solid guarantees for colleges and universities to accelerate their advancement to the forefront of the world.
It is particularly important to recognize that building world-class universities cannot be achieved through a one-size-fits-all approach. Each school must showcase its individuality and strengths while leveraging its unique advantages.
The distinctive features of colleges and universities should have both common Chinese characteristics and their own unique goals, traditions, and resource endowments.
As for Zhejiang University, we focus on three aspects of distinctive features in our teaching: one is to emphasize the cultivation of innovative and entrepreneurial talent, to build an integrated educational and enterprise environment that combines education and business, and to create a full chain of entrepreneurial education ecosystem; the second is to emphasize the distinctive features of academic interdisciplinary meetings, to promote the optimization and adjustment of the academic system, to create an interdisciplinary institutional environment, and to actively cultivate emerging interdisciplinary fields and landmark interdisciplinary achievements; the third is to emphasize the distinctive features of the university system and social services, to carry out in-depth international exchange and cooperation, and to accelerate the formation of a comprehensive Zhejiang University research and production alliance.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the university spirit and let the university spirit resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the “Seeking Truth and Innovation” school motto, “Study hard, be virtuous, be discerning, be down-to-earth” common values, and “Embrace the world’s rivers and seas, be enlightened, be virtuous, be a pioneer, be loyal to the country” are the newest expressions of the Zhejiang spirit.
This is an important safeguard for the school to adhere to the correct direction of study, continuously accumulating cultural height and gathering spiritual strength. It is rich in content and has far-reaching significance.
In particular, “Hainan River and Yangtze River” emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, embodied by the belief that “the world’s talents are at my disposal”; “Tzu Chi” emphasizes the spirit of seeking truth and doing good, referring to the university’s pursuit of truth while also being attentive to ethics and morality; “Open up the future for the nation” emphasizes the spirit of reform and innovation, which encompasses the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific and technological innovation, as well as the spirit of reform and development, breaking new ground; “Serve the nation” emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always be in harmony with the destiny of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and values are precisely the soul of Zhejiang University for 120 years.
The wise hear without hearing, the enlightened see without form.
Chinese colleges and universities must take a further step to consolidate the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and firmly grasp the historical mission and the era position of higher education, accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independent freedom, let the university spirit and the spirit of the times, the national spirit mutually inspire and stimulate each other, thereby providing an endless source of motivation for achieving national prosperity and revitalizing the nation.

As NFTs hit the market, the crypto community came up with a new concept.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia. Some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic started to earn stable income by playing this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet-raising game based on blockchain technology, which includes various NFT games. It is currently the NFT project with the highest transaction volume and has exceeded $3 billion in transaction volume.
According to TokenTerminal data, Axie Infinity’s daily revenue exceeded US$8.2 million, ranking second to Honor of Kings.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity officially announced that its daily active users have exceeded 1 million.
Axie Infinity’s popularity will bring a new “palytoearn” mode to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players will no longer be a single role. In addition to obtaining fun and economic benefits from the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This subjectivity is not granted by the game developer, but is ensured by the blockchain technology.
Seeing news about a friend's stock, my biggest feeling is the company's choice on the track, that is, to choose the industry with a large growth space, with a market size of at least RMB100 billion; secondly, to choose the industry with good future growth potential; and finally, to choose the industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the industry development stage, and whether the track is flat or hilly indicates the competitive landscape of the industry.
Good luck on the wrong track!
The first order of business for the new year is to review the 2021 adjustments to the 2022 battle plan.
The strategy is to "do the things right," that is, to do things correctly.
And the strategy is to "do the right thing," which is to do the right thing.
The strategy lies in finding direction, and the tactics lie in landing. In most cases, there is room for strategic thinking in tactical thinking.
For example, how to increase customer numbers (tactical thinking) can be considered in the current field, whether to continue deepening or extending horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, how to improve customer retention rate (tactical thinking) can be considered by thinking about how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in terms of improving activity participation rate (tactical thinking), KPIs can be set correctly to achieve the right goals, such as improving target customer participation rate, activating inactive high-value customers, and targeting new customers; in terms of improving DAU (tactical thinking), whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable can be considered.

Chinese-American group accuses Yale and three other Ivy League schools of discrimination in admissions - Xinhua | English.news
Xinhua News Agency Washington D.C. May 23 wire (Reporter: Xu Yanmei) More than 130 ethnic groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting that three Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College - discriminate against Asian applicants during the recruitment process.
The day the suit was filed, the Asian American Education Alliance held a press conference in Washington.
At the press conference, Zhao Yujian, the chairman of the organization, said that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of US top universities has doubled, but in these three US top universities, the proportion of Asian students has basically maintained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that in the so-called "holistic admissions" process, these colleges "systematically and persistently discriminate against Asian applicants."
Zhao Yukun said that according to the research of scholars such as Sanders in 2014, among these three colleges, the proportion of applicants who are relative is the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the U.S. Education Department also shows that at all Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, while Yale University and Brown University have essentially quotas for Asian applicants that have been in place for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukui told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope the US Department of Education and Department of Justice will conduct investigations and take measures to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asian applicants after filing a complaint.
They also hope that colleges will take the initiative to pay attention to this problem and change their admission policies for Asian students.
None of the three colleges has yet responded to the complaints.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015 to protest Harvard University's admissions policies, which the U.S. Department of Education rejected on procedural grounds.
In addition to the US Chinese community, the US Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani education groups also participated in the appeal.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Yuyang Town, Zhejiang Province from his real estate agent. After multiple on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of purchasing the factory building with the relatives of the owner of the property, Lin, and transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit that day via bank transfer.
Lin signed as the collector on the "Factory Purchase and Sale Deed", which stated, "If the buyer does not want to purchase this factory, the deposit shall be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit shall be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties shall sign a factory purchase and sale contract within a week."
However, due to the failure of the two sides to reach a consensus on major contract terms such as the scope of factory sale and payment method, the housing purchase and sale contract could not be signed.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Lu a few days later.
Good houses are not easy to see in China. The down payment has been made, and the mortgage has also been prepared. They are just about to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell. This makes Mr. Lu feel frustrated and angry.
To this end, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit with the Yao Municipal People's Court against Lin.
After legal proceedings, the court held that the failure of both parties to sign a formal contract cannot be solely attributed to the defendant. It should be reasonably inferred that the negotiations failed. Therefore, this case should not be applied to the fixed penalty rule. The defendant shall not be liable for the double return of the deposit.
After the verdict, the defendant filed an appeal.
Recently, the Second Appellate Court upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer reminder] Be cautious and take necessary precautions in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary due diligence obligations, such as verifying the ownership information of the house, whether the house is occupied by others, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes from arising when fulfilling the contract.
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang said in a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the U.S. holding the "Leaders' Democracy Summit" is "a conscious attempt to draw a line in the form of democracy, to make democratic tools and weapons, to use the name of democracy to do the opposite of democracy, to incite division and confrontation, and to divert domestic contradictions."
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has been imposing its political system and values on people, promoting 'democratic reform', imposing unilateral sanctions, instigating 'color revolutions', and causing disastrous consequences.
Democracy has already become a "weapon of mass destruction" for US intervention in other countries.
This summit is an action by Biden to fulfill his campaign promises.
The two-day meeting was conducted via video conference, and leaders from 111 countries were invited, including those from Taiwan, but China and Russia were not.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democracy, saying that the United States did not have the qualification to hold such a summit.
There are also questions being raised internationally and domestically, such as criticism of inviting leaders with authoritarian tendencies, such as leaders from countries like the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, who have been accused of organizing the summit for geopolitical purposes rather than for democratic purposes.
Germany's new Chancellor, Angela Merkel, also participated in the video conference.
China's Foreign Ministry statement on Saturday said, "Today's U.S. disease of democracy has been fully displayed. Issues such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social division, racial conflict, wealth gap, etc. are becoming increasingly prominent." The U.S. democracy is built on the capitalist foundation of "the rich man's game."
In his speech, U.S. President Biden said, "As the leaders of the government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reforms, achieve transparent accountability, and better resist the forces of authoritarianism and those who seek power for their own selfish interests at the expense of the public good."
He stressed that democracy is not something that comes naturally, "We have to keep updating it in each generation and in my view, that's the defining challenge of our time.
Biden also said, "At a time when global democracy and human rights are facing sustained and troubling challenges, democracy requires champions to defend it."
The United States pledged to carry out a one-year action plan after the democratic summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy worldwide and provide support for independent media.
The United States hopes that countries will make specific public commitments to improve their democratic systems before the planned physical democratic summit in late 2022.
Biden said, "Let us all countries fulfill our commitments and report our progress next year."
Okay, I'm afraid he might have sent the wrong address.

Here is a simple introduction for everyone.
Red Badge of Courage:
The Glenkinchie 12-year-old single malt Scotch whisky is a blend of around 35 whiskies from the Scottish distillery, which has a rich, fruity and traditional Speyside character, with a hint of honey and smoke.
The initial aroma is fresh and strong, with a hint of lavender and a strong smell of burnt wheat.
The drink can be consumed on its own or mixed with your favourite tipple.
Red card wushu enters the country, in order to adapt to the taste of the local people, red card wushu + Coca Cola or Snow White or New Citrus soda become a long-lasting fashion.

The above three are the best drinking methods for Wushu practitioners. Everyone can try as a reference and hope that the introduction of the editor can help everyone.
Education Thoughts: How university examinations make “scholars” and “scholastic”
Three students from Lanzhou Transportation University wrote letters to the school administration expressing their confusion about the university exam and proposing to raise the difficulty of the exam, change the exam format, and make the exam truly reflect the students' actual level.
After all, college exams have long been a "hot topic."
In the university campus, students come from all over the world, with different ability levels and varying degrees of learning, so the learning conditions are diverse.
It is inevitable that there will be different opinions when assessing a group with such diverse characteristics.
Of course, if the exam questions are too simple and repetitive, it will inevitably cause a completely different feeling.
Students who do not study hard may be able to pass the exam by concentrating their efforts just before the exam. If they want to try other methods, they may achieve double the effect.
In this way, students who usually do not put effort into their studies can pass the exam and even get high scores. Students who usually skip classes and are good at homework and note-taking may have some “strange phenomena” during exams.
In this way, it seems that the students of Lanzhou University are not the only ones to reflect the problems that exist in the college entrance examination. It is believed that this situation is not exclusive to Lanzhou University.
From this perspective, it is necessary to commend the three students who wrote direct letters.
In fact, those who have passed the college entrance examination are well aware that the phenomenon of “sitting for the exam” is not uncommon, and even in the examination room, there are students who carry small notebooks and ask the teacher to hold their hands.
In the author's opinion, as a teaching quality evaluation direction, measuring the passing rate of a university exam is more important than the teacher's comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific topics based on this.
Entering the college undergraduate stage, the majors begin to differentiate, and many majors focus on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that mastering the basic knowledge points of a discipline is the content to be tested in the college entrance examination.
The basic knowledge of undergraduates is mainly the basic theories and general knowledge of their respective majors. From the perspective of knowledge, the changing space is not large and is basically fixed.
As the teacher said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics 20 years ago is still the focus now."
But the knowledge points are basically unchanged, and it does not mean that the examination types are single and the questions are repeated.
In many universities, exams are usually composed of a set of questions, which are then compiled by senior professors in the department, and the exam papers are also participated in by all the teachers in the department, so as to overcome the problem of question duplication to a certain extent.
However, to propose a set of test items that are in line with actual teaching and learning, the titles of the test items should be based on the overall learning situation of the students, and should follow a normal distribution. In addition, it is necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and analyze the degree of student learning comprehensively, so as to enable the test items to have dynamic control over the difficulty and type of the questions, so as to both highlight the examination of basic knowledge and the examination of ability, while also innovating the design of the test items.
The examination is the mainstay of university education. There are different types of exams, and students will have corresponding study plans. This has been the case in the past and will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University attaches great importance to students' suggestions and has implemented a revised plan throughout the campus.
Require each teaching unit to organize teachers to carry out self-examination and comparison with the examination, formulate examination questions and related regulations, strengthen supervision and verification of examination questions and the examination process, refine the grading system, and strengthen the comprehensive examination of all teaching and learning areas.
From the perspective of the mechanism, solving problems such as single-type test items, repeated questions, etc. is a topic that universities need to face. Of course, corresponding regulations need to be issued, but this is a daily matter. It is necessary for teachers to have a comprehensive grasp of the teaching situation. It is not only necessary to penetrate the teaching content, but also necessary to penetrate the student learning situation. Both heads need to be penetrated. The interaction between teaching and learning will be better, and the examination will be more in line with the actual situation. This will enable “scholars” and “scholars” to get their due.

Golden Lady Wedding Dress Photo Shoot (Nanjing Store) has not yet opened a branch
Because we did not arrange our time well before taking photos, we changed the time twice. Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
We chose a good weekend to shoot.
Ms. Gong's staff, whether they are consultants, makeup artists or photographers, are all praised.
That was the first time in my life that I had my makeup done professionally, wow~ I can't believe that one day I will look that good, haha.
Xiao Jie and another girl (sorry, I forgot her name) are very patient and skilled at makeup.
The scenery was shot in Yangzhou City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and it was not cold. When taking photos, the makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes, headgear, and would help us arrange them if they were not quite right.
The photographer is also very humorous, and feels very happy every day.
When taking photos, because we have seen many cases online, we don’t want to make the guests delete too many photos, but when we take photos, we really don’t feel that we should add more photos. In fact, there was not a single photo that made us want to take more photos. The 24 photos in the package were all included, and there were more than 10,000 photos added. At that time, I was stunned. I was afraid that I would take too many photos.
Today's photo editing is done by Lanlan, and she sent it to me. I looked at two photos and thought they were not very good. They immediately helped me to re-edit them.
I compared the photos that my sister took before, and I felt that the photos we took were really satisfactory, simple and fresh. It was exactly the style I wanted.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go and take wedding photos with Ms. Han Gin-fu!
Bundle price: RMB3999
Ms. Gong thanked everyone for their sincere wishes and said that the future is bright.

3,200 newborn babies without birth certificates in Sabah
(Yibing, 11th day of the month) Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the shortage of special anti-counterfeit paper, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since October, and the number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, Kari Amunts, the head of the agency, assured that all babies who have already applied for a birth certificate will have their information recorded in the system and will be issued with a birth certificate next week.
At the press conference, he made an explanation on the report on the printing problem of a web media for 10 months.
He said that the problem emerged two months ago, and Sarajevo is also facing the same problem.
One reason is that China's manufacturers of anti-counterfeit paper have been affected by the epidemic, causing delays in shipping to our country.
He explained that the counterfeit paper used by newspapers in Saba and other areas is different from that of other areas, so they cannot borrow inventory from other states.
Kuala Lumpur: The latest batch of counterfeit paper was received in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing.
The agency will send a person to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday to collect the goods and print the final stage in Sabah immediately. It is estimated that the application can be handed over to the applicant within two working days (on December 20).
We will notify the applicants to collect their admit cards from the respective regional offices.
He added that Saba has issued a total of 20,480 birth announcements so far this year.
Since about 7 o'clock this morning

Education information: Beijing compressed 2016 middle school enrollment special talent proportion - Xinhua
From the 21st to the 22nd, the pre-enrollment special examination work of Beijing's primary and secondary schools will be unified organized by the district education commission.
This year, all districts in Beijing have compressed the quotas for talents. The competition among talents has become more intense.

Students who have sports, arts and technology specialties and have registered online are eligible to participate in the specialty enrollment examination.
In order to facilitate students to participate in the examination, Dongcheng District will continue last year’s examination arrangement, setting 1-2 examination sites in each school district, a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination points will be divided into examination periods, with an hour as the unit of time, and the students will be examined according to the examination periods on the same day.

President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee: I firmly believe that China has the ability to host the Winter Olympics - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Sarajevo, December 11 wire 12 Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee Chairman Kvesic recently said that Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and firmly believes that China has the ability to organize the Winter Olympics.
Recently, the Chinese ambassador in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Qiangping, met with the President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, at the Sarajevo Olympic Center.
During the meeting, Kvitkina actively praised the relations between Bosnia and Herzegovina and China and said that she was deeply impressed by the excellent organizational work of China during the Beijing Olympics in 2008. She firmly believes that China has the ability to hold the Winter Olympics in a special period. Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee is actively organizing participation. Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes to take this opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sports.
Qiang said that China and Canada have a special "Olympic necktie".
In 1984, the Sarajevo Winter Olympics was successfully held here. Two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open the curtain, presenting a concise, safe and brilliant show to the world.
China's embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes that the two countries will deepen their exchanges and cooperation in the preparation of winter sports events, the training of athletes and other areas. The Chinese embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play a bridge role, using the Beijing Winter Olympic Games as an opportunity to promote the continuous deepening of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, so that the two peoples can "move forward together" and achieve good results in the Beijing Winter Olympic Games.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" award ceremony, and Qi Ping was invited as a guest to award Bosnia and Herzegovina's best young athlete.
Videos promoting the Beijing Winter Olympics were played in a loop at the venue.

48小时核酸阴性，设“缓冲区” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 11 wire (Reporters: Dong Ruifeng, Geng Tiancheng) The Ministry of Public Security recently issued a notice to strengthen the prevention and control of the novel coronavirus epidemic in coastal cities. It requires people who have recently left land border cities (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau by land border) to hold a negative nucleotide test certificate for a period of 48 hours before arriving at a land border city. After arriving at a land border city, they must undergo at least one nucleotide test.
According to the notice, the time period for the aforementioned requirements is from the date of determining the coastal city scope in each province and city to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that conditional coastal cities may study setting up epidemic control buffer zone within the jurisdiction.
According to the relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Division, for some coastal cities, cross-border trade is the local economy's main pillar, and people from both sides frequently cross the border.
Implementing segmented and differentiated management policies, turning a single prevention line into two lines, is expected to achieve border transfer, reduce the risk of outbreak, and minimize social impact and costs to achieve maximum effectiveness in disease prevention.
Recently, there have been several outbreaks of domestic gathering-type epidemics in our country, which were all imported from foreign cities.
The aforementioned notice pointed out that some local epidemic surveillance alerts were not timely, high-risk personnel were not properly isolated, regular fumigation was not implemented, formaldehyde testing was irregular, refrigerated items were not properly disposed of, centralized isolation management was not in accordance with regulations, and epidemic emergency disposal was not scientific and accurate enough.
The notice requires to focus on improving the urban epidemic prevention and control mechanism, strengthening the epidemic surveillance warning system, implementing border control measures, and accelerating the filling of gaps in the urban epidemic prevention and control short board to prevent and control the epidemic.
The notice emphasized that the cities on both banks of the Yangtze River should study and deploy the prevention and control of the epidemic in parallel with the work of ensuring people's livelihoods, publicize and open up the hotline for ensuring people's livelihoods, regularly check the latent problems in the supply and price of basic necessities, and timely solve and actively respond to the prominent problems reflected by the public.
According to the notice, the coastal cities referred to include those with open land, water and air ports in the counties (cities, districts, and autonomous regions) where they are located, as well as the cities where they are located (provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities). The specific scope will be determined and announced in a timely manner by the provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) based on the needs of epidemic prevention and control.

U.S. military cover-up of My Lai massacre exposed in new video - Xinhua
(Video source: Oil Pipeline)
On December 11, a micro-documentary called "Killer Robots" on the oil platform caused widespread attention.
The movie tells the story of the United States launching the Afghan war under the pretext of "anti-terrorism", forcibly imposing American democracy on Afghanistan through war, and committing various crimes against humanity for 20 years.
Using unmanned aerial vehicles to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian facilities, distorting humanity and establishing a killing group.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up a "black hole" to torture and humiliate "suspects".
The atrocities committed against humanity have stirred up more hatred among the Afghan people.
As the video says, the US "anti-terrorism" war "becomes more and more fearful".
The war did not bring peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only brought a diseased country and countless killings and destruction.
Watch the video and let us together uncover the truth behind the US's pretext of "anti-terrorism" and its bloody massacre!
Unexpectedly, I came across the following article. From the perspective of business and preservation period, it talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the tax-free zone to do packaging. Although packaging is deep processing, it is not within the scope of operation of the tax-free logistics company. Here are some words that may explain why the customer wants to do this.
I went to many chocolate factories and saw many production lines of chocolate.
In fact, the powder in the pouch and the powder in the ear is the same material, there is no difference.
So everyone will certainly ask: Why is the warranty period for packaging one year, while the warranty period for hearing aids is two years or longer?
Or, to put it another way: Why is there such a big difference in price between the earrings and the bags?
In fact, many consumers or mothers believe that this is because of the different raw materials, so the quality is much better.
In fact, the raw material is the same, but people think that the more expensive it is, the better it is.
There are also consumers who, after eating, said that the aftertaste or flavor is not the same as they heard!
Now I'd like to say a word or two about the cost, where does it come from?
If their raw materials are the same, why are their prices so different?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the packaging price is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept. This means that manufacturers have low profits or even no profits. So, how does the manufacturer survive?
So they have a big upside in terms of pricing to protect their profit margins.
As a result, most manufacturers are promoting earplugs rather than earmuffs.
There are so many brands that spend tens of millions or even billions of yuan on advertising every year. Where does this money come from?
It goes without saying.
With the development of society, the marketing expenses, such as the promoters of shopping malls, the rental expenses of shopping malls, the gift expenses of products, and the advertising expenses, are also constantly increasing.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly introducing new products, and they are listening, and their prices are also constantly rising. In fact, these are new products resulting from the increase in market costs.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits. In fact, the cost increase of their raw materials will not exceed 3.4 yuan.
There are also some brands that will do anything to promote their products, including hiring doctors at hospitals to help promote their products. They earn profits ranging from 30 to 80 yuan for each doctor they recruit.
China's relevant laws absolutely do not allow such a way of operation. In fact, such a practice is to cheat consumers.
It is recommended that everyone buy powdered milk in cans and store it in cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation and sealing of powdered milk, and have no impact on children.
In addition, do not think that the warranty period of packaging is longer than that of packaging. If the warranty period of packaging is the same as that of packaging after opening the package, it is only because packaging after opening the package is not easy to preserve and easy to deteriorate.
The food was cold, dry and hard to eat.

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua
When visiting the book fair, it is often possible to feel the heat of successful educational books.
Today's successful books, many of which are praised, are "the best principles" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it," then tell you what you need to do "is what."
In other words, let's talk about the most important and fundamental aspect of "how to do it".
Therefore, these books have a common characteristic - either work hard and do your best, or do nothing at all; either 100%, or 0%; either climb Mount Tai, or do nothing at all.
This "best practice" will make everyone agree that it is "absolutely right", but 99% of people will be scared at the starting line.
Because this theory preaches a path of "you have to be determined, you have to remake yourself, to make a 180-degree turn," which is almost everyone's fatal weakness.
For those who adhere to the status quo, who cling to the old ways, who refuse to change, you preach to them about the need for change, you play the guitar like a cow.
The vast majority of people will hesitate at the threshold of “transformation”, reluctant to take the first step; or they will make a decision to “transform” based on momentary impulse and pain, and take the first step bravely, but it is often short-lived, and they will fall down after a while, unable to persist.
Mr. Masanari's famous dialogue in "From Tomorrow" is the most classic representation of this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with the "best practice" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limits of ordinary people, making the vast majority of people "dream of the door".
Perhaps, "the second principle" is a way that may lead more ordinary people to achieve relative success.
The core of the "second best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "small wins lead to big wins", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Everest, just climb the small hill in front of your house, because that is always better than standing still.
In summary, doing anything is better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in threshold, it is more likely for ordinary people to persevere, and the probability of success will increase as long as they persist.
However, the road to success following the "second best principle" is slightly longer.
In summary, although the "best principle" may seem like a rallying call for success for everyone on the surface, it is ultimately only inspiring for a minority; whereas the "second best principle" can effectively inspire more people and benefit as many as possible.

Qinghai Lake shrimp resources increased by 71,000 tons - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Xining December 11 wire (Reporter: Lu Xiaofei, Zhang Hongyang) Reporters learned from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results show that the reserves of Qinghai Lake shad have increased by 71,000 tons this year compared with last year, reaching 108,500 tons. Compared with the initial protection period of 2002, the cumulative growth has exceeded 40%.
The cormorant, a well-known species in Qinghai Lake, is a precious fish in Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in ensuring the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecosystem in Qinghai Lake.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale slaughtering and overfishing, as well as the deterioration of the aquatic environment, the number of Qinghai Lake's naked carp has sharply decreased. In 2002, the reserves of Qinghai Lake's naked carp were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the Qinghai Lake naked shrimp was listed as an endangered species in the Chinese Red Data Book.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the closure of hatcheries, prohibiting any unit, group, or individual from catching and selling crucian carp and its products in the main rivers and tributaries of Qinghai Lake and its surrounding areas.
At the same time, through the artificial breeding and discharge, as well as the cleaning of the main inflow and outflow channels of Qinghai Lake, and the design of scientific and reasonable "overpass" and other measures, the protection efforts of Qinghai Lake have been continuously strengthened, and the reservoir capacity of Qinghai Lake has been increasing year by year.
Yang Ling, deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Office of Qinghai Province, said that up to now, Qinghai Lake has released nearly 180 million fry for artificial breeding and has contributed more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake’s loach resources.
The Sanjiangyuan area in Qinghai Province is an important ecological barrier and water source in China and Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the Qinghai Lake water area, protect aquatic wild animals, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai Province has successively issued notices of key areas of the Yangtze River, Yellow River and Qinghai Lake for the prohibition of fishing, and has built a "one river, one lake, one key area" comprehensive management system.

It's been an hour and they haven't sent it yet.
Just saw an example of a plagiarized article, it's too long.
Knowledge is power.
Most girls will experience their first period at some point between the ages of 13 and 15.
He will be back every month or so, health permitting.
However, it is not a regular pattern to be able to accurately predict, with a standard deviation of about a week, it needs to be prepared in advance, and sometimes the luck will change suddenly (advance a few days).
The duration of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of pain vary from person to person. Some people take three days, some people take a week; some people have little bleeding, some people have a lot of bleeding; some people have no reaction, some people are in pain until the ambulance arrives; the pain changes with time, and not being in pain does not mean that you will not be in pain for the rest of your life.
The bleeding lasted for 24 hours a day for several days, and only by using a sanitary napkin or sanitary towel to absorb the blood could one prevent it from staining the sofa.
The main reason for the pain is due to the secretion of testosterone. At the beginning of the physiological period, the pain has not come yet, so it is necessary to take bupropion promptly to relieve the pain at the beginning of the month. After the pain begins, it is useless to take bupropion.
Before the physiological period, due to the excessive secretion of uterine blood and testosterone, it is easy to get pregnant.
If it's been about a week, it's time to get your period.
It is best to change the toilet paper every 2-3 hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Excluding sleeping time, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces. If you add the pre-prepared ones, it may be 50 pieces. It is not necessary to use a new piece every month.
Replace the sanitary towels every 5-6 hours or when they are completely saturated.
The hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle may be quite turbulent, and the luteal phase may also be unstable due to changes in internal hormones, making it very uncomfortable.
But the official crime rate data shows that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not use emotional issues as an excuse.
The fluid is not just blood, it contains shedding uterine lining.
After the end of the menstrual cycle, the uterine lining becomes the thinnest, and then gradually thickens. This can be understood as the uterus is a house, and prepares to receive guests every month (the lining thickens) by building a new house (the uterus thickens). If there are no guests, the house is dismantled (the lining is shed) and rebuilt in the next month.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. For several decades, it takes about 24 hours every month and causes pain in the abdomen and lower back. Who would want to go through this?
However, human beings are born because their mothers have menstruation. Menstruation is to prepare a house for you to stay for 10 months when you first come to this world. We should thank our mothers for their healthy menstruation.
In the past, many things that women did were suppressed. Society brainwashed women into believing that they were dirty, disgusting, and that was just the way it was. But times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting and that women's bodies are disgusting in preparation for bearing children, they should not say it in public. Girls, stand up and don't think that way. You have never experienced it, so you don't know how to understand. Men, don't forget your duties and obligations. Don't be so forgetful and ignorant. How can such an attitude be good when facing your own mother? How can such an attitude be good when thinking about your own children?
Finally, give the hygiene towel a try. It's really useful.
Today is the winter solstice, but the weather is not as expected.
In addition to ordering food for yourself,
Hope store owners will check the products before selling
Is the electricity leaking from the bathtub faucet?
Choosing the right bathtub can play a good therapeutic effect on foot health. Today, the National Beauty editor will provide an answer to this problem, hoping to help friends.
With the improvement of people's health awareness, bathtubs are becoming more and more popular among consumers. A large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, ranging from more than 100 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice.
In the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health-related home appliances such as bathtubs have exploded in sales, but bathtubs do not have special industry standards, so there is a certain safety risk.
Swimming in electrified water is really too dangerous!
Mr. Lee told reporters that he bought a bathtub as a birthday gift for his father, but when his father soaked his feet in the bathtub, he felt that his feet were itchy.
Mr. Lee thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub at first, but it turned out that the vibration function was turned off. His father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Lee tried the electric pen, and lo and behold, the pen lit up. Mr. Lee was astonished to find that the water in the bathtub was electrified.
Afterwards, he contacted the merchants. The merchants' attitude was also good. Although he had withdrawn the bathtub, Mr. Lee still felt uncomfortable.
Because he found that the long-established bathtub, which has been popular for a long time, has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the highest temperature setting, suitable for which group of people, which material is safe and so on.
However, in general, bathtubs are not prone to electrical problems, but it does not rule out the possibility that some products may have loose connections during production.
Therefore, choose a freestanding bathtub when purchasing.
Hydropower separation, no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take a pen to write.
The 13th Provincial Tea Festival kicked off.
Hunan Daily, December 10 news (Reporter: Zhang Shaowu, Hu Haining, Translator: Liu Xiaoling, Photographer: Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the New Red Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Expo Center. The tea industry, tea science and technology, tea culture, and tea industry goals were showcased.
Hu Shulin, Executive Vice President of the China National Association of Wholesale and Retail Cooperation, and Ye Yongping, Executive Vice President of the Provincial People's Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
At the opening ceremony, Professor Liu Zhonghua, academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, made a keynote speech and said that the source of Huanghe is new, and the rise of Hutong tea is injecting new impetus for "Five-color Hunan tea".

The main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, and have driven a large number of tea farmers to increase their income.
With the changing of the wind, the red tea gains new strength.
Tea industry experts in the province said that picking green tea and picking red tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens is on the rise.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders granted the use of “Hunan Red Tea” trademark to the fourth batch of enterprises that won the right to use the “Hunan Red Tea” trademark, and launched the “Hunan Red Source”.
In the new tea exhibition hall, tea merchants from Fujian Province immediately placed an order for a high mountain tea called “Icy Spring”.
Wang Qinghua, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, said that the tea market is affected by various factors such as the epidemic. However, from the scene of the tea fair, there are many bright spots.
A splash of red tea, injected with the cultural connotations of tea, people are lively and enthusiastic, and the tea industry welcomes the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be cancelled?
I don't want it, because I can't stop there and he couldn't get it
Metaphysics is the study of questions that cannot be directly answered through sensory perception.
Metaphysics is the basic principle of philosophy, aiming to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The English translation for this sentence is: The term "formal learning" is derived from the phrase "formal learning is the way, informal learning is the tool" in the "Essay on the Transmission of the Meaning of the Great Treatise" of the Yi Jing. It was coined by the Japanese philosopher Inoue Takeo (Meiji era) from the metaphysical translation.
The branches of philosophy include metaphysics, natural science, and their extensions.
Ontology is the study of which nouns represent real existent entities and which nouns represent concepts.
Atheism, which denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis believes that all phenomena can be explained by natural reasons, and was proposed by philosophers who support scientific and evolutionary theories.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to the research method that attributes everything to natural causes.
Psychology is a fundamental philosophical branch that studies consciousness and its relationship with the body, particularly the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between the mind and body.
Knowledge theory is a philosophical branch that explores the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline that systematically thinks and studies human moral life; here, ethics is defined as all the norms of behavior recognized by a group of people or a culture.
There are two main branches of ethics: meta-ethics, which abstractly studies ethical theories or critiques, and normative ethics, which evaluates various moral views and provides moral guidelines for right or wrong behavior.
It studies what kind of moral codes people should follow), applied ethics (applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including biomedical ethics, political ethics, etc.), and descriptive ethics (gathering information about how people live and drawing conclusions from observed behavior.
Its critique of ethics is not based on a priori theories, but on the actual choices made by moral agents and observed true dilemmas, which promote all moral factors of the decision, and discuss the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics, medieval Christian ethics.
The first part: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by people like Voltaire and Montesquieu.
Second Part: The Ethical Thought of Religious Reformation, Represented by Calvin.

Ding Zilong: A loyal friend.
I sincerely thank all my friends for their humanitarian aid over the past 30-plus years, especially since I issued a humanitarian appeal in my name to domestic and foreign friends in the early 1990s, which has not been interrupted to this day.
Nowadays, the vast majority of survivors' parents have passed away, and their orphans have grown up and become independent.
Your generosity has helped us through some of our darkest moments.
Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping across the globe, and most donors have retired for the year.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to stop giving humanitarian donations to us - the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian aid activity should have drawn a perfect full stop a long time ago.
I will always remember your love and firmly believe that your sacrifice will be remembered by history.
Due to various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please forgive me!
Please accept my sincere blessings.
Ceramics industry: Please allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of the International Foundation for China Studies (IFCSS) and the Minneapolis China Development Foundation (MCDF) in providing humanitarian aid.
In the process of providing humanitarian aid, Amnesty International and the Minneapolis-based China Democracy Foundation are two parallel organizations, and the implementers of the projects often cross over.
（苹果日报图：天安门母亲网站由陶业负责打理。）
Aid often fails to reach those who need it most.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Mr. Ding, a special group called "Tiananmen Mothers" was established to coordinate and be responsible for the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MCDF established the "6.4 Orphans Education Fund", and 11 years later, in 2009, after all the 6.4 orphans graduated from college, MCDF set up the "6.4 Orphans Hard-to-Care-For Elderly Assistance Fund" and has been implementing it to this day.
The funding for these projects primarily comes from donations made by alumni and the community during the 2011 earthquake, as well as individual generous donations, and is supported by the Brother University Democracy Foundation.
Since 2018, it has also received support from the Labor Research Foundation.
It wasn't until last year, 31 years after the Tiananmen Square massacre, that the six Tiananmen Square protesters finally received partial donations sent in the name of the 1989 protests from Hong Kong.
During this period, China Human Rights also independently carried out their humanitarian relief projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding called for a stop to the 6.4 donation is for the donor to consider. We are indeed some retirees, and our income is not as before retirement. We would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding’s letter of “friend”.
We will respect the decisions of the heirs, terminate the project within two years, and restore it immediately if necessary.
For those who have been selflessly delivering humanitarian aid and risking their lives for years, we express our gratitude and respect.

If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place for training. But if you don't have this idea, it is better to self-study. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you are planning to break into this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with self-control and weaknesses, training is an even better choice.
If one's self-control is relatively strong, they can choose to self-study, but it will be quite tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First of all, we need to look at the teaching force of this institution. If the teaching force is not strong enough, this training institution is meaningless. Of course, some newly established training institutions do not have strong teaching force.
Secondly, before choosing this training institution, it is advisable to investigate the institution and its students. After all, only the students of the institution can know how good or bad the institution is, and whether the courses are good or not.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't provided any information about your own situation, which is related to learning this thing and your personal situation.
For example, your profession, age, the language you want to learn, even which city you are in, all of these will be related to the industry you are studying or want to work in.
If you are a student and have not graduated yet, or if you have graduated from a computer-related major, then I would recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are quite good. However, the cost of learning is high and the time investment is considerable. You need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
However, if I say these situations, self-study is very convenient. Nowadays, there are many learning resources on the internet that are free, and there are also many training resources on B站. If you can't find resources, you can contact me for free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some relatively classic books that can be combined with video comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional but are willing to pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. This way of learning is not very tiring, and the teacher's explanation is also very detailed. There are also people who specialize in answering questions. In addition, there is also help in learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, nowadays, many training institutions will sign employment contracts with a certain amount of commission, and will recommend students to companies after their studies, so that the interview process for finding a job can be avoided.
These are my opinions based on the information you have provided. Since I don't know your specific situation, I will only briefly introduce them without going into detail. If you have any other questions or need further consultation, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Every stage of life presents different challenges.
Often, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face it head-on.
Since it is impossible to avoid, it is better to face it directly.
The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be defeated; but if you face difficulties head-on, the problem will eventually solve itself.
China and Saudi Arabia join hands to hold the first contemporary art biennale in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Riyadh December 12 wire (Reporter: Wang Haizhou, Hu Guang) The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia - the Dhahran Biennial of Contemporary Art opened to the public on the 11th at the Dhahran JAX Art District, located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participated in the exhibition.
This biennale is co-organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Urumqi, China. Tian Fengyu, the Director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, serves as the Chief Curator.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of the current biennale is "crossing the river by feeling the stones", which is a metaphor for the reform policies adopted during the social and economic transformation period, as well as reflecting the current situation of Saudi Arabian social and cultural development.
The exhibition spans an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings showcasing six units: "Touching Stones Across the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Thinking on the Edge", "Going Public", "Beautiful New World", and "The Spirit of Art".
In particular, the works of 27 Saudi artists, which account for more than 40% of the total number of works in this exhibition, include painting, installation and performance art, etc. in various forms. The works of 12 Chinese artists have also attracted a lot of attention. Some artists use recycled materials in innovative ways to create their works, such as Xu Bing’s “The Endless Story Series: Fox Mountain” (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
Bakri, the chief executive officer of the Doha Exhibition and Convention Foundation, said that he hopes the current biennale can establish an international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to understand the cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interaction.
Tayseer Barakat said: "The aim of the biennial is double-edged; it enables contemporary Saudi artists to participate in the global dialogue and also enables Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the two-year exhibition period. Artists, curators and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Unified standards for rural public interest positions - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12 wire (Reporter: Lin Bifeng) To continue to provide employment assistance to eradicate poverty, consolidate and expand the achievements of eradicating poverty, Yunnan Province recently issued relevant policies to promote the management of public interest positions in rural revitalization to help promote the comprehensive advancement of rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, at present, Yunnan Province has developed a total of 448,300 public interest positions in rural areas, which are used to employ disadvantaged rural groups such as poverty-stricken farmers. These public interest positions play an important role in helping the disadvantaged population to achieve employment and income growth, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, effectively improve the ability of various public services in rural areas.
This new regulation was jointly issued by seven departments including Yunnan People's Congress, Rural Revitalization, Finance, etc. It mainly provides unified norms for the scope of recruiting rural public interest personnel, fund management, position development, position management, etc.
In terms of position development setting, the new regulations clearly stipulate that positions should be developed according to the principles of "needs-based deployment, position-based recruitment, dynamic management, total control" "who develops, who uses, who is responsible" and "one person one post, voluntary openness, unified management".
The recruitment process must follow the steps of advertisement, application, screening, publicity, appointment, pre-employment training and arrangement of posting.
In addition, the new regulations have clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the main departments responsible for the development of rural public interest positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public interest positions, and have stipulated that the departments responsible for the development of rural public interest positions shall purchase commercial accident insurance for the placement of rural public interest position personnel. The relevant departments are required to regularly supervise the subsidies for rural public interest positions.

Hello.
Can I cancel my order?

whether it has been cancelled or not.
2. Although the right wing had its golden age in history, it did not last long, so it was short-lived because giving children too much sunshine makes them too bright, and giving them too much water makes them sweat. If they were too ambitious, they would lose their hair.
But in fact, the right wing has played an active role in social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution, the positive significance of the right wing should not be denied in terms of developing the economy, raising technology, and promoting institutionalization and human rights protection.
As for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Lee Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his statements and also very respectful of Lee Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes social issues in China seriously.
However, I oppose his counter-revolutionary theory. I believe that counter-revolution is unnecessary and will inevitably lead to social turbulence, damage to people's livelihoods, political groups becoming disordered, and foreign intervention.
Fourth, changing or improving China requires patience and the attitude of being responsible for the country and the people. Political schemers who try to take advantage of the situation are not the right wing, but the confused.
Let's talk about something else.
Left, in fact, are the orphans of time and politics.
If the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will also listen to some right-wing speeches and analyze their thoughts when necessary. Then the left will not have this problem, because what the left wants is the garbage thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I've seen some of my friends behaving like hypocrites, denying their leftist tendencies, and getting very angry. I don't think it's necessary.
Don't try to argue with a hysterical woman or a leftist, they're both irrational and can't be reasoned with.
Don't try to prove that you are right, and don't try to make your opponents and leftists admit that they are wrong. Why bother?
This is what I tell my friends: when the anti-fascists call you a fascist, when the anarchists call you a cop, it proves that our middle way is the right way!
Many people had dreams when they were young, but as they grew older, they forgot their dreams, or pursued their dreams, but became eccentric.
And ideal gradually fades away, even the young dragon becomes a demon.
To me, left and right generally refers to constraint and freedom. From the perspective of historical and cultural genes, China should be left-leaning as a whole.
While the domestic right wing emphasizes efficiency and development, the left wing strengthens regulation and focuses more on fairness and safety.
Nowadays, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the US are competing with each other. The left is definitely the winner, and it is estimated that it will take many years to continue.
If you don't understand, just give it a thumbs up
What else is there to say, it's just a figure of speech
Over the past two years, the US embargo and blockade of Huawei’s chips have not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented crisis, but also caused enormous losses to “US companies”.
The US imposed sanctions on China's semiconductor industry, requiring domestic enterprises and allied enterprises to block our country's semiconductor industry at the same time, which directly caused the orders and profits of global semiconductor suppliers to be affected, reducing the research and development investment of semiconductor production enterprises, reducing production capacity, and causing disruptions in the global semiconductor supply chain.
Today, "shortages" have spread to major industries worldwide, such as automobile production suspension, mobile phone price increase, and almost all industries that use chips are affected.
In order to grasp the sovereignty of "chips", more and more countries' technology giants are moving towards the path of "going global".
In order to firmly control the global semi-conductor control rights, control the development of China's semi-conductor industry, the recent frequent actions of the US are to host the "Semiconductor Summit" and to invite the heads of 64 countries to establish the Semiconductor Alliance, and to raise funds to support US domestic technology giants such as Intel, which spent US$2 billion to build two semiconductor fabs in Arizona, USA, and to open up overseas semiconductor foundry business.
When most people thought that Intel's move would have a certain impact on TSMC, and may even take away TSMC's "rice bowl."
The reason for this is that Intel, as the old brand technology giant in the United States, has been digging in the semiconductor industry for decades, and has a large number of talents and technical reserves. It is bound to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat Tesla.
However, for Intel's decision, Zhang Zhidong, the founder of Tsingtao, did not hesitate.
At the “2021 Masters Forum” held in April this year, Zhang Zhiduo made a shocking statement. He said that Intel’s investment in the crystal plant was a ridicule to Intel’s foundry business.
Zhang Zhiduo is quite reluctant for Intel to enter the Jade Computing Area. This is because Zhang Zhiduo still harbors a grudge against Intel for more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was the diamond in the crown of the US manufacturing industry, occupying the top position in the global semiconductor market and dominating the world of semiconductors.
In the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips were dominated by a few strong players.
At that time, the semi-conductor industry was characterized by IDM mode. Chips were designed, manufactured and packaged by a single factory, and Intel was the representative of that era.
However, this pattern makes some small businesses unable to bear the heavy burden. Many semi-conductor entrepreneurs can only hope and step forward.
In response to the market demand, in the 1980s, the semiconductor industry began to emerge with the phenomenon of subcontracting and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhoude heard of a company that specialized in chip design. He thought that since there was a company that specialized in design, it would be possible to establish a factory that specialized in crystal manufacturing.
Not long after, Zhang Zhidong's dream became a reality, and Taitong Power was born.
Ta Kung Pao reported that Guangdong Ta Kung Pao Electronics Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Ta Kung Pao Electronics”) has targeted the “crystal processing” sector as its main business. It does not provide design services, but only provides crystal manufacturing subcontracting services.
At that time, just founded Tsingtao Electric, in the face of the giant Intel, Tsingtao Electric was just a small fry.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhiduo once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that Tsingtao would only engage in the manufacturing sector of the semiconductor industry, it obviously had too high an opinion of itself and refused to invest in Tsingtao.
Zhang Zhoude also believes that Intel at that time did not attach importance to the crystal round process service.
He did not expect that the giant of crystal glass manufacturing services at that time will also start to make crystal glasses.
So Zhang Zhidong felt that Intel's entry into the smart glasses market was very ironic.
Today, the market capitalization of TSMC has already exceeded that of Intel.
Faced with the strong offensive of Tesla, Intel is also reluctant to take a firm stance.
Today, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has already moved to the 3nm process node, while Intel is still stuck at the 14nm process node that was introduced 7 years ago.
It's not easy to overtake.

Today, let's take a look at some strange searches.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot topics: Dragon Boat Festival in February, the rise in the price of good friends, and the Gala event. Public opinion peaks and then [indices decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipate. If a second generation of public opinion emerges, a small bump will reappear.
They look almost identical to the [Internet Sentiment Dynamics Model] displayed on the website of the Internet Information Office.
What is the exceptional sentiment?
Randomly select six hot searches related to the same event and present them in the form of [peak], [teeth], and [cliff].
【孤峰状】：加热自己，迅速冲榜热搜，引起大众关注；【锯齿状】：周期性加热，确保话题盘踞热搜榜单；【断崖状】：集体撤离，该热搜发挥完“功能”，接到新任务、冲向新战场。
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the time difference is not much, it must be that the unified water army received the mission and started the new offensive.
It can be seen from the professionalism of Black Publicity that dozens of hot topics are listed at the same time. Which ones are eye-catching, which ones are responsible for popular science, which ones are provocative, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones incite emotions, which ones affect decision-making, which ones are listed in batches, which ones are listed by node, almost considering all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Journalism is a science that should be objective and impartial, and should not be influenced by subjective factors such as personal opinions or emotions. It should only be based on objective data, and even black PR cannot escape the consequences.
Anyone who passes by will leave a trace, let's dig it up together.

Mauritius and other countries first found opioid drug-resistant cases - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 12 wire: Xinhua News Agency foreign correspondents report: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported their first cases of COVID-19 mutant virus.
On the 10th day of the month, Mauritius reported two cases of opioid drug infection for the first time.
According to Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, one of the infected persons is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27; the other is a Mauritian resident who tested positive on November 30 after coming into contact with a person who had recently travelled to South Africa and returned.
After hospital isolation and treatment, the two patients' HIV test results turned negative, and they have returned to their respective homes.
On the 10th day of the month, the Ministry of Health of Cyprus announced that the country had confirmed its first three cases of COVID-19 infection.
All three of them are students. They returned from overseas travel earlier this month. Due to their mild symptoms, they did not go to the hospital for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the opioid epidemic, the Seychelles government has been increasing its efforts to control it.

At the beginning, it was introduced by friends because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look at the initial budget of RMB70,000.
A series of scams began as soon as they entered the store.
I just went to the store for the first time to show them my floor plan. They did not go to the site to measure the house. They told me my 135sqm house was worth RMB700,000. They did not know the brand of the material.
Their second scam is that as soon as you walk into the store, they will try to pressure you into buying gold (and this money is gone once you hand it over to them, unless you have enough experience to argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we will give you such and such a discount.
This is a big hole, and I'm a living example of being deceived. I lost more than 10,000 yuan in a moment of impulse.
There were a lot of issues with the price he gave me - it didn't include water and electricity renovation, it didn't include any doors or cupboards in the bathroom, which were the big ticket items.
In addition, their service fees are higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in the company, and from the beginning, they should have been clear about everything so that I could sign the contract.
When I went to collect money from them, they looked very experienced and had a special team to deal with you.
It's the customer's problem, no matter what.
There are various responsibilities and a lot of details. I don't want to talk about them one by one. Just don't choose them because my friend also found that the house they renovated was of poor quality. They will charge you various fees later.
Grandpa, they are the heads of the original scammers, but now they have been changed to beauties. It seems that they have been changed again.
So don't choose such a dirty decorating company.
In the future, when people choose, many people will check these consultations because decoration is not small money.

Taurid meteor shower to peak on November 14 - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Tianjin December 12 wire (Reporter: Zhou Rongjian) Astronomy enthusiasts said that as the last major meteor shower of the year, the Geminid meteor shower, which is one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, will peak on December 14. Friends who love meteor showers can observe after midnight on the same day.
On December 13, 2018, Beijing amateur astronomer An Jiu captured the Geminid meteor shower in Qinghai.
Most meteor showers come from periodic comets, but the parent body of the Geminid meteor shower is 3200 Phaethon, a member of the Apollo asteroid family.
The Geminid meteor shower is also the second known meteor shower not caused by a comet "pregnancy."
Tianjin Astronomical Society Chairman and astronomy expert Yu Xuejian said that, just like the meteor shower of the congratulatory film, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year. “The peak period” can be from December 4 to 17.
The meteor shower is known for its high flow rate and stability, and is called the Northern Hemisphere's three major meteor showers along with the Zodiacal Light Meteor Shower and the Geminid Meteor Shower.
One significant feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteoroids have slow speeds, rich colors, and many fireballs, making them suitable for both viewing and photography.
Yang Ying, a Tianjin amateur astronomer, captured the twin-tailed meteor shower in Tianjin Tangshan on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year's Geminid meteor shower will peak on December 14 at around 15:00, with a ZHR (Zenithal Hourly Rate) of 150.
The Geminid meteor shower forecast chart.
Last year's Geminid meteor shower, the "shooting stars rain," left a deep impression on people. However, this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the degree of splendor will be reduced.
On the 14th day of the 11th month of the Lunar Calendar, the moon phase is waning, and the bright moonlight will cause interference to observation. The moon will set after midnight, and the radiation point of the Geminid meteor shower will rise relatively high at this time.
Friends who enjoy the meteor shower will be able to observe for a few hours after the moon rises in the early morning hours, but they should dress warmly."
How can we observe more shooting stars?
It is not recommended to observe in the city, you can choose a place with a high altitude, small light pollution, facing northeast, and then wait patiently until the moon is down to observe.
It should be noted that the flow of Taurid meteoroids in all directions is very large. It is not necessary to observe the radiation point of the Taurid meteor shower all the time.
If you are a photography enthusiast and want to capture beautiful "shooting stars", the best choice is to use a wide-angle and large aperture lens, and use high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Considering stability and sustainability, a three-legged stand, spare batteries and power cords are also indispensable."

What are the differences in market positioning between laser TV and traditional TV?
In my understanding, the traditional TV referred to by the questioner should be understood as a liquid crystal TV, and the difference in market position between plasma TV and liquid crystal TV mainly lies in the following two points:
First, the laser TV focuses on the large screen market.
Compared with the fully opened market position of liquid crystal TVs, laser TVs obviously focus on the large screen market, that is, laser TVs are born for large screens.
Currently, mainstream liquid crystal TV screen sizes range from 55 to 65 inches, while plasma TV screen sizes are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting users' demand for large screen TVs.
In recent years, the share of laser TVs in global shipments and sales has been increasing, accounting for more than 60% in the overall TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to Cihang's prediction, in 2020, the sales volume of laser TVs will grow by more than 140%, and will continue to maintain a high growth rate.
The reason for the good performance in the large screen market is mainly attributed to the excellent performance of the laser TV in protecting the eyes.
Based on the reflection imaging principle of laser TV animation, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight of the liquid crystal TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process under natural conditions, and the stimulation to the eyes is smaller.
The Shaoxi Experimental Laboratory of China Electronic Technology Standardization Research Institute and the ophthalmology experts of Beijing Union and Hospital conducted a strict comparison test of laser TV and liquid crystal TV under the same viewing conditions, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
Data verification: Infrared TVs do indeed have strong eye protection features, and in some cases, even have certain improvement effects.
In the current era where vision health is increasingly valued, laser TV not only attracts more users with its protective eye advantage, but also opens up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Secondly, laser TVs focus on the high-end market.
In contrast to the continuous decline in liquid crystal TV prices, the current retail price of laser TVs is mostly above 10,000 yuan. With the upgrading of screen size and light source, the price gradually increases.
What makes plasma TVs so expensive?
It is reasonable.
With the continuous development of light sources and technology, plasma TVs have many advantages that liquid crystal TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
Based on the super short throw projection technology, the projection distance of the laser TV is relatively shorter than that of traditional projection devices. It can achieve 100-inch screen experience within a short distance, and the required space is small. The host is also small and takes up little space.
In terms of brightness, large brand LED TVs can reach over 2000 nits.
In addition, with lower heat generation and less device damage, the life of the TV is also longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with a variety of cutting-edge technologies such as true 4K ultra high-definition picture quality, artificial intelligence systems, and synthetic screens, which can provide users with more shocking visual and audio experiences.
We are not talking about pseudo-demands, but about the product with differentiated needs, such as picture quality and input-output ratio. Plasma TV is not a dish for audiovisual enthusiasts. If you want to consider both large screen and viewing environment, you can try. There are pros and cons. Weigh the pros and cons and make your own judgment.
In simple terms, the super-wide-angle near-focus projector - laser TV - in order to approach the screen, had to use expensive super-wide-angle lenses and reflective mirrors, which does not conform to the best optical design.
To block out some of the ambient light, use a micro-structured Fresnel lens, which is expensive, and you can swap a 65-inch LCD for an 80-inch one.
Another point, I particularly dislike the projection theater merchants touting the good point of anti-reflective coating for the eyes. The light on the screen that can be seen by the eyes is direct light. If you reflect it onto the ceiling, the eyes can't see it. The liquid crystal TV is also "reflected" in this way. Is the ceiling not illuminated when you open the TV?
Furthermore, if the screen is not anti-glare, it will not be the same.
The glare (flicker) effect of high contrast screens is often overlooked. At a certain angle, a large amount of light is reflected into the eyes, making it truly difficult.
Beauty of Visual Arts Photography Museum selects high-quality shops. Temporarily there is no branch
Added the WeChat appointment date, and the lady immediately sent me the available time slots. The reply was quite timely.
Before entering the store, I looked at the shooting works in the store. There were more outdoor wedding photos. The photos were beautiful and the shooting styles were many.
After the day was over, I simply chatted with her about my ideas, and she patiently helped me try on two sets of clothes that I had styled. In the end, we agreed on a makeup and styling concept, and the photographer set up props and guided us through the details.
However, it may be because we did not exchange specific shooting ideas, so the resulting footage is not the style I wanted, but it should be beautiful 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer will help select photos, exchange post-production styles, and feel quite meticulous.
It takes about half a month to get used to it.
The second "Hungry King" dining event was held. Most of the participants were able to choose one piece of clothing to be photographed.
Finally, she chose a black dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process took about 2 hours, including makeup and shooting. The photographer in charge of shooting is a 95-year-old brother. He is a little bit too young. I hope to give more advice in guiding the customer's action in the future. Talking is very healthy. The shooting process is quite happy.
Shanghai Visual Art Photography Museum selects high-quality stores
Welcome to the first page, come and take a look at Queenie~
Fill in your name and phone number before trying on clothes, and you can try on as many outfits as you like. The staff are very patient, and the service attitude is good. They will teach you how to pose for the camera after you have chosen your outfit. It takes about half a month to receive the photos, and they look almost the same as the original.
[Environment] Overall still good.
There is a lot of optional clothing.
There are only three beauty salons in the area, and there is a photography studio next door.
[Service] is very enthusiastic and also very meticulous.
Image consultants are very patient.
The photographer will also take the time to teach you the moves.
If dissatisfied, the photographer will also actively propose retouching.
[Experience] The make-up is a bit outdated. The original double eyelid has been glued with three eyelids.
Eyebrows have also been trimmed, which is a bit awkward for those who don't usually draw them on.
Ten days after the photo was taken, but the P effect is not satisfactory. It feels that the eyelid pads are still very obvious.
Because it was not clear what style to choose, she tried two sets and the results were quite different. In the end, she chose a black suit and said that this set was quite retro.
After choosing clothes, we began to do makeup. The hairstylist and makeup artist were very patient in helping me, and the result was very satisfactory.
She started taking photos as soon as she finished doing her makeup. The photographer gave me instructions on how to pose throughout the entire process. It was very easy and comfortable.
After finishing watching, he carefully selected four of his favorite scenes. He said that he would make a movie within 15 days. The ending was very satisfactory.
It's been 3 days and no response... Because your system can't recognize my credit card, I can't join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing was that I used the same credit card every time I made a payment.
I have to pay shipping every time now.
Can you give me a discount first, and then you can collect my monthly fee after your investigation?
Do you buy insurance for the umbrella?
Small umbrella is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the perspective of setting conditions: According to the provisions of the Insurance Intermediary Regulatory Guidelines (2015 Revision), to become an insurance agency, it must meet three key words: shareholders, founders with no major illegal records in the past three years, minimum capital of RMB 50 million, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
In fact, these three requirements are quite stringent. In summary, it means that the insurance company must have strength, must be approved by the state authority department of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) of India, the shareholders must have a good track record, and as a small umbrella insurance for insurance brokers, the insured must not have too many doubts about whether the small umbrella insurance is legitimate or not. After all, these three requirements are not something that any insurance company can achieve.
It's not bad, it's reliable.
In terms of insurance products, the Little Umbrella Insurance is like an insurance supermarket. Many companies’ celebrities are selling on this platform, such as the latest newly listed and Thai Super Maha 5, where the insured and the insurer are Thai Life Insurance. Little Umbrella Insurance is just a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to doubt its credibility.
From the perspective of the payment model, the products of the Internet platform, because of the absence of the operating expenses of the business points and the cost of the staff salary, are generally priced higher than the offline products, and the payment methods are flexible, such as monthly payment, which can alleviate the burden of the insurance premium and can maximize the leveraging of the insurance.
This is also very good.
Consider it.
From the perspective of professionalism, this is particularly important because insurance is a profession that requires a high degree of professionalism. Many internet product customers can self-insure, which can lead to many misconceptions, especially in the areas of health notification and employment. Non-insurance professionals often add their subjective opinions when insuring, feeling healthy or compliant, which can lead to many claims risks.
I myself have done insurance phone sales for “Tencent Weibo” (similar to Alibaba’s online insurance brokerage platform). I am very responsible and will tell everyone.
The insurance of the Internet is true, but also relies on luck. The unreliable part is the people, the Internet channels do not have professional practitioners, and there are many sales deceptions.
For example, 1 yuan of insurance can protect 6 million. Buy insurance and get 60,000 yuan of heavy illness insurance for free. These marketing strategies are not wrong, but they are a bit evasive. They do not tell the insured that the first month is free, and the second month will be charged according to the normal fee. More than 30 to 200 yuan. Many customers do not understand why they have been charging for a year or two.
The insurance company will pay 6 million yuan.
The free delivery of mobile phones is only for special numbers such as 6666, 8888 and so on. If there is a winning SMS, you don't need to recharge and no one will remind you.
(For the insured, this is another pitfall) Free insurance of 60,000 yuan of critical illness is short-term. If only relying on this, there is no other commercial risk. If a critical illness really occurs, 60,000 yuan is not enough to solve the problem. The rest of the life will be in trouble.
Currently, the state is also severely cracking down on the misleading of Internet insurance sales.
Therefore, overall, the platform is not a problem, the product is not a problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the staff.
It is suggested that the subject should carefully consider the overall situation. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products and more opportunities and products for customers to choose from, and some products have better cost performance than online products.
I have helped more than 59 internet customers, ensured the offline products, and promised to save each person 2000-3000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
I: Mingya Insurance Broker, with more than 3 years of enterprise management training experience, serving nearly 1,000 enterprise users, cooperating with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will customize insurance products for customers based on their needs. During insurance, I will strive to win the best nuclear protection results for customers. After insurance, I will arrange insurance policies for customers and handle insurance claims.
Grow with each customer for life.
I hope my answer can help the subject!
According to the definition of the Insurance Regulatory Department, Internet insurance refers to the insurance business where the insured can independently complete all the insurance procedures after clicking the insurance link.
In this process, the insured person does not need to sign, the insurance advisor does not need to sign, all steps can be completed by the insured person independently.
Although there is no "ceremony" in Internet insurance, and even the printed paper contract may not exist, but this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model is somewhat similar to the normal flow of telephone sales, but buying insurance will also have a fatal problem, that is, the subsequent service may not be up to par.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for several decades. When we purchase insurance, should we not carefully consider whether the "intermediary" we choose is a "life insurance intermediary" who can accompany us for the long term and provide services to us in many years to come?

No problem, remember that there is no need to arrange for the return, I have bought elsewhere, do not want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and abuse, and I cannot tolerate such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this scourge.
If you don't look at the party and faction, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized behavior.
Since you started sending friend requests on Facebook, publishing provocative posts, and attempting to publish my alleged home address and father's name on social media, I have taken an unresponsive attitude.
You persistently tagged me even after we broke up, and your so-called friends continued to discuss some embarrassing and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook. They talked about my appearance, height, good manners, and even talked about whether to add me or not. I... also gave up.
How do I know that later on, many of my friends sent me a Facebook friend request with a photo and sexually harassing comments about you.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer stay silent.
After my news of reporting the police, you did not calm down at all, but even more angry.
I don't care about your political background or your status, it is necessary to respect both sexes in our society.
Yes, you can continue with this provocative, evasive, insulting, abusive language, you can continue to say that you only care and are concerned about me, you can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and even deny that it is not your drawing or continue to make all attacking comments.
You're right, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My looks and physique don't need your commentary.
I don't even think there's a girl out there who would be willing to be humiliated that much to get her name out there.
A friend asked me, how are you doing?
I said well, you wouldn't believe.
I don't think any girl would be able to say that after being treated like that.
Only those who lack basic morals would choose to harm a woman in such a way.
I believe that honesty comes naturally to people.
I left some comments for everyone to review.
No one should be able to bully you into doing something you don't want to do.
I can only say that you are the public enemy of civilization.

Vietnamese People's Daily - Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
During the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, two major conferences were held to discuss topics related to digital technology enterprises and the digital transformation of the country, as well as the economic recovery and development after the COVID-19 pandemic.
Minister of Information and Communication Nguy n Quang said that in 2021, although the COVID-19 pandemic continued to spread, the number and revenue of Vietnam’s digital technology enterprises continued to grow, reaching nearly 10%.
In 2021, Vietnam has focused on cultivating digital products, concentrating on solving major problems faced by Vietnam, and many digital products have been exported. Vietnam’s digital technology ranking has also improved.
Minister Nguyen Manh Hung called on digital technology enterprises to take responsibility for developing the national digital transformation platform, and the task of developing these national digital platforms is the responsibility of the state.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and state agencies are studying, developing, applying, and transferring digital technology enterprises, organizations, and individuals to share mobilization and pooling of all social resources to develop Vietnam’s technology enterprises, promote the country’s digital transformation, and share breakthrough ideas and solutions for economic recovery after the epidemic.
At the forum, Premier Li Keqiang emphasized that digital transformation is the inevitable trend of the world and an objective requirement for development.
Digital transformation has become a global issue, and digital transformation services are available to the entire population, so it is necessary to mobilize the entire population to participate.
People and enterprises are the core, main body, goal, and driving force of digital transformation.
Therefore, all policies should be for the people and the enterprises.
Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister, emphasized that digital transformation should reflect national spirit and should be mainly driven by internal factors such as strategy, long-term and decisive factors, while external factors should be important and breakthrough.
At the same time, he believes that the digital transformation should be driven towards in-depth development and sustainable development, participate in the prevention and control of the new coronavirus epidemic, economic recovery and development, addressing its after-effects, overcoming the phenomenon of natural resource depletion, and promoting green transformation and developing green energy.
Digital transformation requires participation in the establishment of databases related to the protection and promotion of national cultural values, historical traditions, national folk customs, etc., and the promotion of digital transformation in areas such as banking, taxation, land management, and logistics.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and the country more prosperous and developed.
At the request of Premier Li Keqiang, governments at all levels, government agencies and enterprises should increase their leadership and guidance in the development of digital technology, raise their awareness of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system for digital transformation, strengthen national management, and promote the development of digital technology enterprises based on the spirit of respect, communication, listening, active and proactive.
During the forum, Nguyen Xuan Phuc attended the 2021 “Made in Vietnam” Excellent Digital Product Award Ceremony and the opening ceremony of the “Made in Vietnam” Digital Product Exhibition.

The Yangtze River Delta has achieved full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency Chongqing December 11 wire (Reporter Wang Jian) Chongqing Fuling Shuiquan Green Comprehensive Service District was officially put into operation on the 10th day of the month. This is the second water-based green comprehensive service district in the upstream of the Yangtze River after Chongqing Fuling Shuiquan Green Comprehensive Service District was officially put into operation on the 8th day of the month.
Up to now, the green comprehensive service area on water has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
According to Qiu Jianhua, Deputy Director of Jianghuai Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, previously, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu and other provinces and cities have set up 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by a large number of boatmen, and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the inland waterway green comprehensive service area is another milestone event in the construction of the green shipping on the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River has significantly improved its ability to receive and transport shipping services.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing all-round production and life services for a large number of vessels and crew members, and helping a large number of crew members solve the problem of “urgent difficulties”.
Two water-based green comprehensive service areas will be built and put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. These areas will integrate living services, production services and public services into one, with green environmental protection as the main theme, and boat repair and emergency rescue services for boats as the characteristic. This will achieve "one-stop docking and multiple services" for boats in the Yangtze River, making the work of the crew more efficient and convenient.
Most powerful weapon in US arsenal makes rare visit to Guam amid China tensions 2022-01-17 多维 亲中共媒体多维报道：中美关系最新消息：最新卫星图像显示，美国三艘航母正在中国周边集结；美媒还披露，美国海军武器库中最强大的武器之一罕见访问关岛，对印太地区美国的盟友与敌手释放重要信号。
According to the Chinese think tank “South Sea Strategic Situation Intelligence Platform”, on January 9, a satellite found the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands.
The Paracel Sea connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea, and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform is expected to be sent to the South China Sea.
This is the first time that the USS Carl Vinson has deployed F-35C fighters and CMV-22 "Flying Fish" transport aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, which has been sailing in the Pacific, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the US on January 3, is also there.
The "Lincoln" also carried the F-35C for the first time, belonging to the 314th fighter squadron of the US Marine Corps.
In addition to the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy has also deployed the USS Ronald Reagan, which is stationed in Yokosuka, Japan, to the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser “Shanghai Lake”, the missile destroyer “Stockholm”, and so on.
On January 17, 2022, the “South China Sea Strategic Situation Sensing Platform” released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering in the vicinity of China.
(Weibo@南海战略态势感知) On January 17, 2022, the US Navy's CMV-22B transport aircraft flew over Guam, the most powerful weapon in the world.
（微博@南海战略态势感知） 另据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）1月17日报道，美国海军武器库中最强大的武器之一上周末罕见地访问了关岛。
The Russian nuclear submarine "Nevada" carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads entered the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
The USS Ronald Reagan, the USS Nimitz, and the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the three aircraft carriers of the US Navy, have gathered in the waters around China. It is rare to see such powerful weapons visiting Guam. Analysts believe that this is a signal sent to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016, and the second public visit since the 1980s.
The USS Ronald Reagan, the USS Nimitz, and the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the three aircraft carriers of the US Navy, have gathered in the waters around China. They are the most powerful weapons in the world. They have visited Guam, a US territory in the Western Pacific. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Spratly Islands in recent years.
It is meant to be China's version of Hawaii in the South China Sea.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The US Navy said in the statement that Russia's nuclear submarine "Vladivostok" this visit to the island strengthened the cooperation between the US and its regional allies, demonstrated the US's ability, flexibility, combat readiness, and continued commitment to the security and stability of the Indo-Pacific region.
The ballistic missile submarine is usually called the "thunder submarine" (Boomer submarine).
The whereabouts of 14 of the US Navy's submarines are usually kept secret.
The secret of the ballistic missile submarine made the "Leviathan" become the most important survival weapon among the "nuclear triad". The system also includes the land-based missile silos in the United States and bombers such as B-2 and B-52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
Talking to friends about the recent Meta drop of 26%, its market value evaporated by US$251 billion, Zuckerberg responded, “We are facing unprecedented competition”. Why?
Meta（原 Facebook）实际上是一家广告公司，收入主要来自广告，今天今日赚钱的广告公司，自己拥有流量渠道。
Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and so on, no matter what kind of positioning, are all Meta's traffic channels.
Moreover, Meta is not only the largest “advertising alliance”, but also many apps are indirectly connected to Meta’s advertising platform to achieve profit.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple's privacy policy, Meta is difficult to get user data information, which affects the efficiency of advertising placement.
Apple's current privacy policy is user-friendly and will clearly indicate whether the user allows the app to access their information. Most people's normal response is to not allow.
If Google were to do this again, the impact on Meta's revenue would be even greater.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta's revenue growth has weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
Everyone knows that Meta does not have business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta's annual revenue comes from China, mainly from companies that make maritime business contributions in China.
Meta has about 500 staff in its Hong Kong office and several dozen agents on the mainland.
Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, and Meta is the only advertising channel that cannot be ignored. Most of the spending went to Meta.
Interestingly, TT is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from TT in the past two years.
All the domestic agents are helping to promote the advertisement of the word “Meta” at the word festival. The performance of Meta in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River is also very good.
I haven't looked into it recently, but it definitely won't be better than before.
The era of Chinese companies spending heavily overseas is over.
Thirdly, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms including TT are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not only the decline in income, but also the lack of expected growth.
The capital market is not only looking at China's income, but more importantly, at the future expectations.
Clearly, Meta's expectations were not met.
In order to tell the market a new story, Zuckerberg talked about "the Metaverse".
The metaverse should indeed be one of the future directions, but the realization cycle of the metaverse is relatively long. This story should not be enough to support Meta's market capitalization in the next two to three years.
Therefore, the next two years should be a relatively difficult period for Meta.
Don't look now, but Facebook is in a very precarious position, with $100 billion to $200 billion in annual revenue. In fact, Facebook is in crisis mode, with no moat to speak of compared to other internet companies and high-tech firms.
Although his several social media apps are now quite popular and mainstream, such as Facebook and WhatsApp, he has no confidence in the face of TikTok’s rapid development, and the gap between them is just a matter of time.
Facebook is very dangerous, and that's why Zuckerberg changed his name and is always looking for new tracks. But I think his track selection is wrong, it's a detour and above all, it's my thinking, for reference.
