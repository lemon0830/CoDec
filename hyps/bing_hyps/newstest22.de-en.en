The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer and therefore it is not a problem for me.
All I need is a number or instruction on what I should enclose with the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs €179.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way to credit?
Basically, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parenting role for their little siblings.
However, I think it's also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Sometimes take a quick look, sometimes help for a moment, sometimes bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be enough children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours when he falls asleep.
From a purely legal point of view, it is probably questionable.
Maybe that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can't think of the title anymore, maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by dousing himself with food and going into the enclosure with his big cats.
The case is taken over by a detective who, after a short investigation, gets to his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The detective has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who, before each suicide, is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of the suicide and document and post the photos on the Internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group, where the patients are transplanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients ultimately face their fear in the most extreme way.
(one woman jumps out of the window, another drives herself to death on purpose)
This confrontation of fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic, which had to do with a fire.
That's the rough plot, I'm pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone knows this plot or even can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available.
Have to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has splinters of wood under the thumbnail (outside) along the entire length.
Tried to pull him with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
Didn't work out and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Due to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on one printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of the gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" loudspeaker along with a sound capsule kit.
Like all members of the family, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It supports the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 speed steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders register fully automatically at a suitable digital control center.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read out with suitable control panels.
For control panels that can only program CVs from 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses allow 16 functions to be triggered.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic login to mfx®-compatible control panels.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® braking distances as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake modules or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC automatic shuttle train enables automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC railways.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to push ahead with booster vaccination
More and more Omicron cases are worrying politicians and scientists in the UK.
By New Year's Day, all qualifying adults in England should therefore receive an offer of vaccination.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress with Corona booster vaccinations than previously targeted in view of rapidly rising Omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omicron variant, we are facing an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Get a booster now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were recorded in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. Dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favour of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns
I have sent out an application.
Today I received an invitation to an interview by e-mail.
I want to reply to the e-mail.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can anyone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any officials.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
Have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Obviously, the chair had an unapparent defect when it was sold.
How else can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working for approx.
14 days no more.
That's why I always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were none.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for that.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write something in some detail about domestic violence here.
I just have to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
One issue that really gnaws at me and unfortunately happens far too often is that many victims can't be helped or think we can't help them.
It's very clear to me that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of snatching the children from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears myself, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to put up with violence.
I often wish I could help with this in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets any easier.
Please, always remember, you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
\Arcane\ on Netflix: What good is the series for \League
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick could be relied upon.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said, looking back on the cup defeat at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
However, this did not subside after the game - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Even more than the naked result, the manner of the performance disappointed.
One example is a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in no less than 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer was provided by John Patrick: "We just weren't focused enough after the win at Tenerife and didn't do what we trained".
Namely, to move the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "To win a great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like being in front of 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered his team's game.
"The best playmaker I've ever coached," praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team, even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants prevent a total debacle and came within eight points after they had already been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time to quarrel.
On Wednesday (7 p.m.), the giants will host the Skyliners Frankfurt, in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different e-mail address, but I changed it.
Yes, I got in touch a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have therefore written to them again.
We originally got in touch half a year ago.
Always out of the egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to inspire his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official instructions" in order to contain the corona virus.
Other performances planned for the Advent season will also have to be cancelled for the time being, according to the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists want to make up for their dates, which were already postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot since he was a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013).
He has made it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blond hair strictly combed back and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
He has been on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" since 2020. Dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand whether it fits in color
It still doesn't work, I can only crave the cover page, but I can't scroll.
Federal Building Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation will not create new housing
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants certainty that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not ease, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not ease, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician emphasized.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 people could be killed.
The pictures from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes wreaked havoc in the United States, possibly claiming up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometer-long swath of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere where the tornado had raced through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, with official numbers rising by the hour.
Hello, I just saw that the showcase #NAME# is sold out.
That's a shame.
Is it still in production?
Or has it been taken out of the range altogether?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
by when do you get in touch?
In case the delivery can not be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order !
I understand that, but can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or placed a return and wanted to ask if it arrived or would be processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into calls for vaccination - based on the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to be vaccinated against the coronavirus.
He has moved to a company that he has blasphemed about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and see and drink tea.
It's been a year.
Obviously, he didn't sew himself into his old place and looked for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'm making a screen shot.

Help with your first own campaign
Boron zum Grusse!
I'm currently leading the adventure Over the Griffin Pass for a group of 4 friends and want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow has been made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and stumble over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
It is there that the further plot is to develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: persuade, act, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever the players can think of.
Group size: 8 common goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
If they are not noticed, the goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a hollow path and flank the carriage armed with three on the left and three on the right with bows, while two stop the carriage with spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
The cart, of course, is gone.
2. If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina is from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so it's not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I wasn't expecting so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I'm guaranteed to take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives again.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send them back
Can you then send the return slips, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was cancelled today in the middle of the F2 race in order to allow the F1 pre-coverage to start on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the plan due to the delayed start and the accident at the start, the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) could still have been shown.
Apparently, however, F1 takes precedence for legal reasons and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was once again ignorance of the rules in F1 among commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so neither of them knew that you were allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation has already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen should be allowed to change tyres when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton on the subject.
On Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such elementary rules should simply be known when commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guesswork as to what is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, I don't like Roos' contrived commentary style, but admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously like even Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant silliness that makes both seem simply unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of unrest to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply gets out of hand at Sky, in the run-off round Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Also, these two channels do less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although Glock and Baumgartner have to be praised for their work, that alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's programming is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language channel to broadcast F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the exception of the advertising in the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
In any case, the terrific F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable channel.
I would be interested in your opinion.
Here: #PRS_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The first lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them already had a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for your support.
Fan pumps are ideal for providing an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, they can be used to operate entire systems.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect several air vents.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, but depending on the model, fan pumps are also ideal for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a décor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something similar.
The MK series has a special, soundproofed design and thus ensures low operating noise.
Installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an air vent or similar by means of an air hose 4/6 mm... And you're ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and should be mounted on the outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent, if water were to run backwards, the water from the basin running through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps
The pumps of the MK series are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even though we give the processing time here on ebay as 3 days, we pack daily and the packages are picked up here every day.
If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to prevent a little bit so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in freight forwarding... of course, no Corona stops here.
Please do not rate badly just because the delivery is delayed, this is entirely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment,... They're having a damn hard time
This also varies greatly from region to region.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Is it also possible to order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The take-off and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom Blue Origin's rocket system is named, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor for the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: aerospace engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not say how much they paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work his missions and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to return to space right away, the presenter said.
"New Shepard" flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometers
The "New Shepard" missile system flies largely automated.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above Earth, at times with zero gravity, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the limit to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned space excursion: Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board the first in July, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October featured 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin deputy chief Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I'm currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting in itself and even being in the lab doesn't bother me (I've already done the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before I started my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely like to study until I do my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially the career prospects.
On the one hand (study check etc) you hear again and again great career opportunities and the profession is totally sought after, on the other hand you hear again and again about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd be really interested:
1) What are you working as at the moment?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you very much for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and I'm thinking about possibly dropping out of my studies in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as an IT specialist.
If you have any experience, feel free to write them :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why I'm only now adding a post.
It is not only before big holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, that there is a lot of stress in our company.
It seems that it is also available before public holidays plus bridging days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, the vast majority of people and companies make a bridging day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that had to go out before Ascension, order here order there, all *necessarily* before the long weekend.
Because... Yes because?
Because "next week" sounds like so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because, in all seriousness, people want to do as much in a shortened week as they do in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very annoyed.
What's the point of this self-flagellation because of holidays?
So what's the point of having holidays if we're not allowed to treat ourselves properly?!
Mind you, the stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all in a completely independent mood.
My question is simple: Is it just us, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Protestant way?
Or do you know that in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has no presents yet.
"The nice thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the festival by baking cookies and handicrafts with her son.
"I love that," Catterfeld said.
But she still has a lot to do before the contemplative days: "For the first time, I don't have any presents yet, I finally have to get started".
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth running of moulting and the formation of new plumage.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird keeping is solely due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large proportion of animal losses that occur during moulting are due to a lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you very much, I found it
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work
GDR handicraft model old building E-locomotive E 95 03 DRG / DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railroader ME issue 11/1968, used with traces of play and missing parts see photos, function good, The class E 95 is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal block trains in the Silesian network,  it is possible that the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
One locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and is being refurbished in an operational state
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to carry 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h cruising speed on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with axle bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckertwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the running numbers E 95 01–06.
All of them survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the refurbishment of all six locomotives was determined.
[4] When, as the reelectrification of the Central German network progressed, there was an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining engines serving as spare parts donors.
Initially, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger numbers, were preferred.
It was only when it became clear that the number of refurbishments of the E 94 could not be increased further that the E 95 became the focus of refurbishment.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
In 1960 they came to the Halle P depot.
They were used in a separate circulation plan mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved to be problematic.
So it often happened that contactors got stuck during switching operations.
Then the man with a hammer and wooden wedge, who was constantly riding on this locomotive, had to release the shooters again during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to months of breakdowns in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the splinter classes, so that the E 95s were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to staff electric locomotives with one man, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were retired in mid-1969, they were the last to be followed by the E 95 01, which quit service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
With the exception of the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a point heating system at Halle Hauptbahnhof.
It took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the initial external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is looked after as a museum.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time for an exhibition at the Arnstadt Museum Depot with new interior and exterior paintwork, whereby the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branching branch lines, where they proved their worth due to their reliable drive and low maintenance.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig to the Central German network.
Initially, the main area of operation was Silesia
Handcrafted model H0 in original packaging, function good, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary in own work, dusty, with traces of play, cellar smell !!, very rare handicraft model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and traces of storage.
Yes, the F-parts are
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The central beam is held by two feet. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we going to do?
I can't set up the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately incorrectly produced.
The center beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent?
No, no surfaces.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose
For me, they are not flat
Could I get them sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, do you want me to explain the problem to you again?
Residential building fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has been incurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume that it was intentional arson.
The Fürstenfeldbruck Criminal Investigation Department has taken over further investigations.
But it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To refute fake news - BioNTech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
BioNTech CEO Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
A friend's illness prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company BioNTech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was misinformation on social media that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on LinkedIn on Friday.
"For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counter these false rumors".
So far, he has refused to do so because communication should not revolve around himself.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote.
He did not ask why.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to fight with facts, so sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself at the moment," Şahin said at the time.
In Germany, there is a prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has long been lifted - and the BioNTech boss has been vaccinated three times, according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: Tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to get by without electricity for around 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The utility Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption was finally completely remedied late in the evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighbourhood help.
The supplier thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the primary technology division, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz fitters were initially only able to put some lines back into operation provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
The fire, which broke out on Friday at around 7:15 p.m., severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since 6 p.m. on Saturday, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9.30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., those most recently affected by the outage have also had electricity.
More than 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood help after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire brigade equipment sheds when help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on the residents of old people's homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary childcare places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the base on the tabletop.
It's Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of these.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm in diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't push them into each other and thus shorten them.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate your feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
will you send me the return slip by e-mail?
the repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before buying, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with that

Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes we have both remade s and are using version 4.5...
could be that they have heard of problems before
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File may be erroneous, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the components of dust, grease and fingerprints with a little soapy water, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you apply the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will no longer be visible later, or on a yoghurt pot.
The first line on the component
Drag the brush evenly line by line.
Slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quick swiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
Otherwise, the dark ones could shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic paints come at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks may occur if they mix with normal paints.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve a true-to-the-original appearance through the decals or decals.
From emblems on aircraft to ship names to trim strips and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Place the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still within easy reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are time, patience and a steady hand when sticking.
Cut out each decal you need individually and arrange them for yourself.
Decals are also called water slides because you moisten their back briefly with water until the backing paper becomes dark due to the wetness.
Then you push the picture just a small piece off the paper and place the piece on the appropriate place on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away from the side.
Attention: Always check whether the picture fits correctly before you push it completely off the paper so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Vacuum excess water with a household cloth.
Warning: not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place where I have read.
I have already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I receive it by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages
ok anyway thank you very much!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
But can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is an "insured event"?
Hello everyone
we were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with private health insurance, it suddenly gets in the way.
First things first:
We had applied for the fertility course in advance at the PKV and got the promise of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the private health insurance.
Some time later we tried to have a second child and made 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not settle them with the private health insurance.
We applied again for the costs to be covered by the private health insurance and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we have carried out more attempts than promised, logically settle the most expensive ones with the private health insurance) we submitted the invoices to the private health insurance and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2 + 3), the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first commitment expire.
The second desire to have children is a new insured event.
According to the terms and conditions, however, the following applies: "The insured event begins with the curative treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts will be reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
* Should the private health insurance have pointed out to us in the commitments that with a birth the further attempts expire?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insured event?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again
All right.
We won't order anything from them anymore.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost good customers.
They are welcome to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague said to me that the repayment has been arranged and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't help it that the chest of drawers arrives completely distraught
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
It clearly states that the repayment has been initiated and I still have not received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#
They can tell their manager that they have now lost two regular customers.
My boyfriend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of this, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, it is not possible for me to procure another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools that can be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
There is no general definition of what a low-budget film is exactly, with exact budget limits.
Here's what Wikipedia has to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to inquire about the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended once again, is it now also reliable?
Vielen Dank
Yours sincerely,
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hallo
"Half victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half-victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on the border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation in the long term, said the researcher from the Berlin Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not giving in, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not resolutely oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It obviously can't prevail if a member state gets it into its head to do its thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, Bossong said: an agreement in principle on asylum policy is made more difficult because the line of "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross borders
According to Poland's border guard, migrants have again tried to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been thrown in the incident not far from the town of Czeremsza by the migrants with stones.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, as the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off sections of the border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to people's countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU's response is pressure on airlines, Bossong said.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic political costs.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly smuggles thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule breaks during the race, according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The Silver Arrows suspect two breaches of the rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the final safety car period, when he is said to have overtaken in violation of the rules.
A second appeal was lodged against the classification at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The manoeuvre took place shortly after the end of a safety car period in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'm looking into it.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you
thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park organises SC Freiburg Fan Day
Europa-Park, namesake for the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park free of charge on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains shone red and white through the jerseys that day.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus and lots of red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 90s.
The first SC Freiburg Fan Day at Europa-Park showed once again how well the partnership fits.
Seeing beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

At the age of 18 years and 228 days, he sensationally becomes the youngest Grand Prix winner in Formula 1 history in Barcelona.
2019, Hungary: Verstappen celebrates his pole debut in Budapest - he is not the youngest.
At the age of 21, he leaves Valtteri Bottas and his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton behind.
2021, Abu Dhabi: The summit has been reached.
Verstappen celebrates his first world title at the age of 24 at the Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi - with an overtaking manoeuvre against Hamilton on the final lap. Dpa

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday in the sold-out Blue Note and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds on her front door.
Yesterday I posted the contact form to return an item, but I didn't receive an email confirmation or anything like that.
My question would be whether my question has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your crazy chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not everyone from our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This e-mail has not yet arrived.
The package would like to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
Yours sincerely,
The LokSound 5 decoder can play up to 10 channels simultaneously.
Each channel can be resolved with up to 16 bit / 31250 kHz and finally offers hi-fi quality on your system.
There is practically no difference to the original audible.
A Class-D audio power amplifier with up to 3W output power controls the speakers, which may have between 4 ohms and 32 ohms impedance.
The huge 128 Mbit sound memory provides enough capacity.
All individual noises can be individually adjusted in volume.
The super-flexible sound engine without a rigid schedule allows the prototypical simulation of all conceivable rail vehicles.
Three separately adjustable braking functions and two alternative load scenarios give you maximum control over your vehicles.
Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like when an afdler says he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it to their i.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just leave it completely.
Yes, wow, then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution is simply completely lost.
Because of me, a god set the whole thing in motion.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just spouting nonsense.
And so you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be approached as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically without distortion or color errors right down to the edge zone.
Magnifiers are often marked with magnification specifications.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to get the most out of your magnifying glass, we ask you to follow the instructions in the "Technical data" table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are generated on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including impact magnifiers.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Fir tree sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many a curious situation when selling fir trees.
Once, a man is said to have even gone home without his partner because both could not agree.
Every year he plants a good 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many a curious situation.
That's what makes the pre-Christmas season a bit fun, he says.
And that with the voucher??
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery, and now I paid full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to argue about the better dish here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat grilled on a rotating skewer.
And both therefore have their name.
On German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems to build a stable Wifi network.
Before that, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and these also arrive at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox.
However, the full 500 no longer arrive at the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, but the further away I go in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. I use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
As a result, with the new fiber optic connection, the Internet is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much Internet speed is "lost" via the power line with fiber optics?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created an account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased to receive an answer.
When it's time to switch checking accounts
Anyone who would have thought that the current accounts would be quiet for the time being is mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to have their customers confirm the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for the overnight money.
In a first step, the limit was lowered only for customers of the Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for call money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly made individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as did ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which even got right against this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the higher courts also declare negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.
The table top for 8 people instead of that for 6 people was supplied.
The base is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She is now officially at the helm of Hollywood.
But her life is like a rollercoaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, she treats herself to one chip a day (yes, you read that right: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of female and male fans still fly to her alike is actually a miracle.
Maybe it's because she's just unlucky with luck - and she's still looking for love.
And crossed the desire to have a baby off the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's wrong with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame will also make you happy.
Unworthy end to a career: Raikkonen must give up
Kimi Raikkonen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
Das war's.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the board, Raikkonen had to park his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in motorsport's premier class.
His wife Minttu and their two children had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 world championship in a Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole 18 times and finished on the podium 103 times. Dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I did the math, I would have to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths on Saturday by driving from third to first place.
Then he changed the material setting a bit and built up a larger lead of 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed over the Briton Brad Hall.
Third place went to Austria's Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also clinched his 22nd victory in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who rides for Stuttgart, finished fifth this time after finishing second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he did differently, I would do it the same way," Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
In the women's race, Laura Nolte took her third victory of the season in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced to World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Olympic two-man bobsleigh champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia finished second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium finish in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I'm super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, but there's also an enormous amount to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!
What shall I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for them.
And now it was said that it had expired, which upsets me very much.
Take a look at the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again because it is currently discounted :)
Why is the shipping only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
Was approved yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module to be a new undamaged one.
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write and maybe one or the other feels the same way...
I'm 24, have cPTSD, a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My boyfriend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand is in the bandage because of the burn).
On top of that, he has a cold and we see each other less at the moment (1-2x week), which makes me very difficult with my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just has a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddly blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and stroking.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
Now we also have housework to do, which we of course divide up.
But cooking myself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD disease is currently quite well controlled, I am reasonably well treated and coping.
Not good, but I'm coping and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot right now (for me), tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow anatomy lesson for which I should prepare at least a little something.
And next week I'll have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what's next is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But after that, the whole thing continues, doesn't it?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I'll get the ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptsbs otherwise.
I think this also has a lot to do with women's mental load and that's why I thought that I'm sure I'll find fellow sufferers here...
In any case, I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today, unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we are going to change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
By the way, twice.
However, it has not been confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed at school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, it was always a bit strange, maybe because I was brought up Christian and I always believed somehow.
What do you think about that?
Maybe you can also talk about work and/or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something?
Hope your question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not? I like to write in English, I understand that well
That's been a very long time, then I would refrain from doing it
It's good, thanks.
I expect a response soon, by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Movie search help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the movie.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway, in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to be able to live herself, I mean.
The crossing, I believe, is also the burial place of the soldier.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight each other.
If that tells you anything, I'm grateful for any answer.
Our little one slept only on her stomach from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can withstand much more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no cuddly toys, go in and have a look more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it straighten up a bit from the belly?
Or is it face first directly in the mattress?
From this you can deduce whether everything is okay.
We all grew up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote yesterday with a colleague of yours and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the closet.
I kindly ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
Let's be clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this station are now under all sow.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a big begging tour.
It was said that it was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: One does not want to be "a running advertising pillar".
What are you now?
A 0815 advertising channel that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which, of course, apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How are you supposed to find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a callback, because my delivered wooden table was delivered defective.
Corpus breakage due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach aches or just for cuddling - My little warmth friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry stones can absorb heat very well and release it again in doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes it particularly pleasant to use, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not feeling so well.
The cherry pit cushion with cover is only suitable as a heat pad for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for atypical odor, mildew or burn stains and dispose of immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover to warm it up beforehand!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (observe the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first heats, there may be a slight build-up of moisture on the surface, but this disappears with repeated use.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions indicated, as longer periods or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at the crook of your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain sensation.
If you have existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If sutures have opened and loose kernels leak out, dispose of the product and loose kernels immediately and out of the reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents that have occurred in connection with the device must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after first leg - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the basement of the table.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under the third coach either.
Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover about interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this one new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone was also sufficient for operation.
Wrong, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply plugged in.
As a result, I removed the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains mode?
Is there something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is.....
Often on tour and still have a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
With a capacity of 20 litres, even larger photo equipment can be easily stowed away with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you need in terms of everyday objects remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and still provide access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: Firstly, conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in messenger bags.
There is a metal locking hook in the flap with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor beams, sturdily riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
This means that the backpack can also be closed reliably without snapping the hook into place.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from others, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of traditional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the suitability of the backpack for everyday use enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and thus easily store both separately from each other - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack in front of your body from the right side, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in between.
Comfortable, easily adjustable shoulder straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if you want to go to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I wait in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
Contact announced on the part of the forwarding agent to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.
So far, I haven't received any message.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I am now already writing with the third support employee, with no one did I get further than the promise that I would get an email as confirmation.
It is the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#
Is it foreseeable when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping it like this is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Wish you a nice evening
hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please give me a call
If you extend the voucher for me, then I will place a larger order right away, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And I could not have guessed that the past year went differently than expected and I was not able to redeem and clarify it in time.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is drawn up, which, with the balancing of the disc, is based on the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of every car with their attractive and eye-catching appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event marked the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing chunks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly, triggering the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from far and wide, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll be looking for gold, recruiting workers, rounding up horses, and building businesses.
You will also get the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone—the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to surpass your fellow pioneers so as not to go broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that "works" more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get extra actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playstyle with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered at Colom), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a ban!
This deactivates one half of the site - reducing the possible actions there.
Then, players take turns performing actions such as extracting resources, moving carts, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the sappers return.
The Promoter rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e. has covered each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players have to defend Coloma from a raid by angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.

"Why children are not tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce debate about education.
Former patients and guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
We parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and is possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries discuss abolition of mandatory testing for triple vaccinated people
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the federal states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated people.
"We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, told Bild am Sonntag.
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to vaccinate," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers as early as next Tuesday." − AFP
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to proceed?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make a purchase through my #PRS_ORG#.
Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you are describing is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
The most common is the hearing of sounds/voices, the less common is the sight of images and the least common is the perception of pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex **by definition had none.
Misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ doesn't help us either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
That's where we lose a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not answered.
Again, the question.
In the order and on the invoice it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Won't I be called?
I had formulated a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle dies at the age of 97
He has made a name for himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
Later he wrote a monumental theatrical history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, hot off the press: "An old man gets older".
The harrowing diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I testify here to my life's thanksgiving".
There are several types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are used as load carriers, especially in Europe.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria annually is not surveyed
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.

Rouladen Tipps & Tricks
A week ago I got a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash.
This was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for :)
Now I have acquired a taste for it and would like to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will make a beef stock for this.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
Where do we go from here?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't so good anymore, but I can do it
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But to this day, I have not received the money.
Would you please check there.
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and gifts.
You haven't bought poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
The VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls allow you to adjust the desired level on the one hand and the distortion content of your sounds on the other.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "gain" and distortion.
Above it was already mentioned that you can even make a power reserve afloat with the POWER LEVEL controller when things get outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an eminently "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack so you can jam along to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot switch, you can also conveniently call up the sounds by foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen it that way with others.
Is it possible for you to send the lamp back?
Since it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with this?
And the chest of drawers?
Will we receive an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it doesn't work, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher as well.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need are a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included in the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the hook provided.
That's not a satisfactory answer and it wasn't worth the wait
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear deal
According to Iran, progress is emerging in the negotiations on a revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because at the beginning there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after an interruption of almost a week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A U.S. delegation is also on site in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
It is the only federal state to have a value above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have exceeded the 1000 mark in terms of corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value as 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had recently always had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had fallen slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
200 seriously ill people with Covid-19 were treated in intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
Since the delivery will not take place until the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, that's it, right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill in anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is an impudence in my eyes.
It's time for change
###MBundestag greetings, I'm u/StratorDE in the Chamber in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Wozu the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can see one thing: it is not extistent.
We have come into a winter paralysis and have extended the summer slump to a few months.
#Wo is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, this is probably simply due to the dissatisfaction with how some things have happened here and how we are in general.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here are still really up for the MBundestag.
#Was we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and found a pile of shards, simply put.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community have come together who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, as this is the only way this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the MBundestag work in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How to recruit new members?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's not a bad thing, that's what we end up with the Discord.
If you feel like it and have time, come to the Discord, work with us and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clunky for it and not suitable for my taste.
For this, I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversize, i.e. in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to do that now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can always contact me by phone to arrange a pick-up appointment.
Is there a manual for the assembly?
How long would I have to get them or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like.
She herself once lived a vegetarian life for a while, and currently rarely eats meat.
I myself was also a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
For a long time, I thought that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that there was displeasure on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too "clumsy"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without you putting it on it.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clearly not an exception according to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be there on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# picks up my return.
Since I can't be there because of a funeral, unfortunately that can't be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date.
From 01.02.#NUMBER# I can be found again throughout.
Lahnstein weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue equipment vehicle of the Lahnstein volunteer fire brigade to Lord Mayor Peter Labonte in Lahnstein's town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Lord Mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment trolley is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, an increase in operations is expected in the long term: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increase in the use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of the time and then the problems began.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, synced, removed, and reloaded the app, NOTHING worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and now I'm hoping for help.
Okay, that's the way it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for facing the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also weapons bearers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into that any further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplistic.
In principle, however, it should be said that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that uniforms and weapon bearers in particular magically attract people to the right of conservative, that these people can of course deal with the lived reality with difficulty, because of course you have not only the average white person, but now many Germans with a migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the exaggerated feminine cliché gays,  because there are fewer or not at all of these in the executive branch, but quite normal men and women who you don't notice when they don't tell you) and I can and must also rely on these people, because in case of doubt they will save your life or use it for you.
But even if it sounds strange at first, in my experience, these fringe groups also have a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less picked up by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly stands up for them or thinks it has to please them, but they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but the fact that they are allowed to openly express their opinions there or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers, who have often been deployed abroad, often start to generalize because of negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing co-thinkers meet from time to time who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, something like this is well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so entangled internationally, and that's a good thing, in my opinion, that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
but it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS_ORG# basket be delivered to Germany for #NUMBER# Euro in black or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I can only ever find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch
Tidier by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with one thing for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I have managed to keep my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases when everything stops, and every now and then it grabs me and I tidy up and clean.
But it's never really "that someone might come to visit spontaneously".
My husband is (unfortunately) no better, it bothers me somewhere, but most of the time household just loses to work and reluctance.
The kitchen is still cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more orderly with a child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been bothering me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me so much, as long as there are no visitors and, for example, there are always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a greater incentive with a child or do you remain sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with special, wide embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and squats)
In addition to the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 has been more than doubled in the Flex System to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels on the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and squats)
High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back area and in the crotch ensure a tight-fitting, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar region increases the flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves comfort, especially when bending over and when mounting and putting on the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility in movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure, which offers a high degree of protection against the cold.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face on the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate hood)
Soft zone located in the collar improves the seal with a finely adjustable width adjustment thanks to a flexible, gentle Velcro fastener that does not adhere to the lamination or seams
Double cuffs with zipper on arm and ankle joints connect a reversible inner cuff with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and resilience when tightening.
Long zipper at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the jumpsuit without hood

Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing in case excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels glued flush with outer and inner overlap
Hemmed edges of the outer cuffs for greater resilience
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in place, especially on deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wristband computers)
Careers in social work – as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in software development and have been out of training for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am noticing more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting over again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or fearful avoidance) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I've been told several times that I seem unapproachable (although I think that's gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth club, but rather in addiction counselling or family support, for example.
But I don't know if the actual working day is really as I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("again the simplest things fucked up") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do it myself by now"/"I keep him from working with my stupid questions"/"he must really think I'm less well-off" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
But you have already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of this either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup
What do you mean by giving back, please!
When I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cupboard.
The bird breaks down the protein ingested with the food into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and builds up its body's own proteins from these, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The formation of plumage in the nestling and the formation of new plumage in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this may lead to disturbances in the breeding process.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON-Bio, you should return to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g of NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is advisable to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
One level measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In case of severe plumage damage, a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the beginning of the plumage formation is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the formation of new plumage is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored in a dry place away from sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to say that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Testimony of a municipal employee in contradiction to the statutes
Hallo r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So felling application submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I think so, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?

Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is thinking about everything that can be thought through.
Before I go out here now .. in short: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you.
I'm currently doing the ref as a career changer.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field there (to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't mention anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point I ended up teaching and was sure that it was - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year.
In the previous times, I always decided to go ahead and at least finish the ref, after that I can always turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely finished.
I've had so little free time the last month that I'm completely drained.
Now it's holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my end of the day was my end of the day.
I had time off.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and such.
But I'm completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it shuts down completely - if it isn't already.
I wonder if I would like to have it that way for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, where I could take time off when I needed it, and found the work kind of boring, but was paid appropriately for it and worked out something together in a team and not as a lone fighter like the one now but most of the time it is.
But then I wonder if in a year's time I won't be back in the same place as I am now and will be dissatisfied.
You can tell it's all kind of confusing, but maybe you as outsiders have advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation where I'm completely exhausted and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, that probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone of mine.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, which has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of the components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply manage the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer an enclosed cabinet and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances bubble up.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to meet newly added sound requirements, which in 2010 has once again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as more numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string stroke as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro dividers, it adapts to the needs of your photographic equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
Of course, what ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a clip-on flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
In addition, you can store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photo things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa with 84 days.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the as-yet-unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has declined somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still did not dare to predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," the president of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, told state broadcaster RTVE.
Millions of dollars in damage
In the almost three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava, which is more than 1000 degrees hot, has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other structures, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, cooled lava created two new headlands with a total size of about 50 hectares.
Banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly hard hit, from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still holds our increasingly divided society together.
This makes it all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of gift-giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", escapes the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked the Christmas days with giving gifts.
Before that, gifts were presented to each other in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background to this custom, which is still popular today, is that St. Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into three women's windows in one night to spare them another life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gave rise to the custom, popular in Germany, of filling the boots of children, especially with gifts.
Protestants took issue with this custom because they rejected intermediaries between God and man as "veneration of saints".
For these reasons, they oppose the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of gift-giving thus shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such questions of detail so narrowly, it only annoys very few that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the St. Martin's custom with St. Martin's singing and St. Martin's procession, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources attest to a tradition of giving gifts on the day of St. Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts was postponed to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful mess over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, who has been assigned some peculiarities over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near royal palace
An armed man was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man who allegedly went into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a gun.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped a little later by officials.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which ones?

The decorative luminaire will harmoniously fit into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The lamp is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Burn time max. 10 hrs.
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly menacing objects from distant galaxies that glow inwardly in color.
"Smart Stone", on the other hand, is quite harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – either in white or coloured light (in six different colours).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it knows how to assert itself thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar luminaire, »Smart Stone« requires neither a supply line nor batteries.
Place the "glowing stone" in any place that is illuminated by the sun during the day.
Two included ground spikes provide a firm hold if required.
The matte white plastic cover itself is sturdy and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly conceals »Smart Stone« inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the case.
At dusk, »Smart Stone« begins to glow automatically; It's up to you to decide in which colour: you can choose from six attractive light colours – in addition to daylight white.
After all, it is also switched off automatically as soon as the battery charge level has dropped to a specified minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts all over again the next day.
I've done this several times, it doesn't work.
It's a pity, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher is not credited to me, then I will not order more as a matter of principle.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year on reddit.
About my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad pain during my period and fucking PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it at that, because due to chronic illnesses I already have to take enough medication that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly, not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten explosive pimples during my last two-year break from 0 to 100 and they were everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it was quite a burden on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year break, the whole thing has never really returned to normal.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without fuss, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me so seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Many thanks to everyone who has read through the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had pre-bupertary bad neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then extensive nodule lichen and the acne issue.
I also ate nutrition in the wake of chr. I tried everything possible and got stuck on a sugar, milk and low-meat mixed diet, because nothing else worked really well.
It may well be that hormones are simply the worm in it, but if you have a construction site everywhere like I do, you don't want to go looking for what else is going wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina or similar.
Wrote and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I always have to work and answer the phone in between and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money were there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
But is it generally available in large sizes?
Since it is available in black in large size

In the name of the people: Lay people make judgments
In the courtroom, they sit on the bench in everyday clothes.
But a lot depends on their verdict, even if they don't wear robes: jurors work with professional judges to determine whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them report in an interview with the "Oeffentlichen" from their time at the Bad Kreuznach district court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the district court on John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.
Hello, unfortunately I can't get into the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# again to the mail address given above?
Can we dispose of the material of the packaging?
We don't have any way to keep them for that long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were ours
Gladly, had already ordered the same armchair in blue in November and also got.would therefore have because they are so beautiful now one in gray
Does the cabinet have to be completely dismantled for pickup and refund?
and when would the pick-up be?
110 kV underground cable to be newly built in 2022
The permit for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This has now been announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometre-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in parts so far.
The blue order number: #PRS_ORG# with the tracking number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a chest of drawers made of glass and the entire sides are burst, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's for all books, that's why the request at #PRS_ORG#, because it's probably a general problem
Ref: Lesson Planning (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been in the ref since summer, I enjoy teaching, but I still have big problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so that in principle I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
At the moment, I just need a very long time to plan my lessons.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me every lesson stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
Retailers fear the Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
Only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed into most shops.
Retailers consider this unnecessary and complain about a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the point of view of the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retailers.
In the case of shops with articles of non-daily use, sales slumps are to be lamented, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey of 1100 retailers by the HDE, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative view of the remaining days of the year.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless hole," Genth said.
According to the report, retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales last week.
Things are only going well in food retailing and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the chief executive.
"2G in shopping will not get us anywhere in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The ribbon regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
According to this, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops on that day with the wristband received.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in the retail sector - as was already the case in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specialises in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Without 2G, frequencies were recently at a good 75 percent of pre-Corona levels, and revenues were around 90 percent.
These figures will now fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, attempts are being made for the centers to find solutions and get them approved.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, in which "visitors can provide their 2G proof once at a central location in the center, for example, and then - equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel - enter all shops undisturbed". Dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG# and got it delivered.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame, which was tried to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and taped it shut.
What do I have to do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
Adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp is provided by a modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and tungsten.
It is also possible to manually adjust and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness with virtually no change in color temperature.
It's a great tool to work on both the film set and in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To carry out the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, simply by pressing one of the memory keys for a long time is occupied and that's it.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that the familiar situation is back when it is switched on again - very practical when working in the studio, e.g. when the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can fall back on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have enough power before the set - a battery tester is also built in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right one on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm sleeve for attachment as a connection, so you can connect directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted by means of brakes on both sides.
Care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery.
It is great that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
This way you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
It's a pity, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after goal-rich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had been winless twice in a row, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SBU turned up the heat, shot the frustration about a mixed start to the season from their souls within just over an hour and won furiously 5-2. "It's amazing what the boys did today," coach Oliver Glasner cheered on DAZN and expressed a "blanket praise, to every single one who was there".
Initially, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurters, who are now in ninth place, still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What happened next also impressed the SBU coach.
"How the players came back and put in a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm incredibly happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was back on the pitch for the first time since matchday four and his muscle injury, also emphasised the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is unbelievably big," said the 27-year-old, who was pleased with the result, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus with him, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It's extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are in top physical condition.
It's top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now they want to "go step by step and remain modest" and "carry out the tasks at this level" until the turn of the year.
Next up is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday (18:30 CET, Sky).
Right now I get the mail that my package is coming back to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately, this would mean for me that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for women's handball ahead of quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's women's handball team snuck off the floor after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and blank stares.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a bitter defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to play against hosts Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were far too anxious and had too much respect for our opponents," said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second in the main round Group III with 8:2 points behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game from everyone and we have to put it out," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement will be needed against the 2019 World Championship runners-up next Tuesday in order to keep the tender dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defence," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now".
Not up to scratch from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to par with the kick-off.
Missed throws and technical mistakes in attack and gaps in defence were responsible for a quick 4-0 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to operating temperature and prevented worse with a few saves.
The DHB team scored the first goal after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counter-attack.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly put themselves in the limelight - and if they did, they mostly failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians.
The game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke also saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarter-finals, however, she is allowed to participate again.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection came into the game a little better and at least came close to five goals by the break.
The already only faint hope of catching up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-placed opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer bring itself to improve its performance and left the floor as a clear loser.

As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we got hold of St. Nicholas Day and take this as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the run-up to Christmas, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve and the Christmas holidays.
What was it like at home back then?
Like with your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is best for the children?
Cleaning your boots?
Baking cookies?
Decorating trees?
Is music played?
Is Santa Claus, the Christ Child coming or is the gift from grandma and grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort to have it as nice as possible as a family at Christmas and around Christmas.
Whether these are fixed traditions, or even something different every year: tell us how it went or continues in your family!
please send me any transaction number. or anything else that might help
Transfer confirmation... etc
I would like to give away a voucher code
Just like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Is that possible for you?
The title dictates, I work as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated, especially in nursing homes.
Since most of these will soon be finished, some of them will continue for me in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to you personally (e.g. "I take drug X, is it compatible with the vaccination ..").
My area of responsibility includes the information for the vaccination, the indication (person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination ordinance and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, but they cannot (are not allowed?) to carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations there myself.
Difficult "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" has caused a lot of thought.
But unlike on many previous days, this time the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
And also not one "for whom everything has to go fast".
This, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment among many Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the stove."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bavarian television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the rather well-known dialect word "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - someting went wrong - try again later.
I rebooted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected to the PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Choosing tires on a road bike - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to train at least a little bit to prepare for my bike tour next week.
No sooner said than done and I rode off with my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Shards of glass on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to do the rest of the track at all.
Since I didn't really have the opportunity to get a spare coat and tube due to the day of the week, I had to turn around again in a halfway bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't quite so bad in terms of moodiness, maybe it's better if I practice changing the tires again before the bike tour.
But now I am faced with a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would be extremely reluctant to get this problem more often.
Now it really wasn't bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, tore off 120km until 2 p.m. on the day I came to pick up the bike!) and who had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding them on wheels for several years.
But when I think about the fact that I have to change tires after 80-90kms while driving, I think I'm in a really bad mood :D
Now I got into conversation with an elderly man on the platform, who asked me in amazement why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; These are supposed to be flattenable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I ask myself: I think I have 25x622 on my road bike at the moment.
They are also (apparently?) available with the Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to use different tires for a road bike?
The swallow side seems to be my absolute! Do you know how to recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and best regards!
Car slams into tree: driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old had crashed into a central island on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unexplained reason and then got into the oncoming lane, police said.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old's car was then thrown against a tree and the man was trapped in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and taken to surrounding hospitals.
yes we have deleted all the books, re-authorized everything and loaded new books

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the big role models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, a suitably designed foot is directly included in this construction proposal in order to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
Due to the principle, the SOLO 15 is very well suited for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but an exceptionally high level of sound is to be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, that doesn't mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears remarkably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble increase.
This is common practice for broadband bands in order to optimize the strongly increasing bundling of frequencies that are too high.
Precisely aligned with the listening position, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
Slightly turned outwards, the high-frequency range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a level of fine dynamics that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final look of the loudspeaker at the beginning in order to plan for appropriate changes during construction.
If, for example, you want to veneer the cabinets, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer applies material again.
After all the plates have been cut to size (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to run the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can later be used flush.
At the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM get an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture "Detail chamfer".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued onto these.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, e.g. if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
This is followed by all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole saw or a Forstner drill, the attachment of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection terminal on the rear wall, is facilitated.
Then you use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded with it.
Subsequently, the base plate is firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex port in the rear wall.
The entire and unshortened cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm hole into the base to the terminal opening and let it protrude about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the case, the cable is routed to the speaker opening and let it hang out loosely there as well.
Subsequently, the crossover is prepared and inserted.
The construction plan of the crossover, as well as the corresponding connection diagram can be found in the following document: Assembly instructions crossover Solo 15.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed, is sealed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can let hot glue drip onto the opening and close it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the sealing accordingly.
Now follows the damping according to the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed in place with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so that the positive line (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and plugged in.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed throughout the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello everyone,
> finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people via switch, so we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – but we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Chill your drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
