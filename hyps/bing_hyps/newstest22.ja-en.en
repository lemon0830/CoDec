The price is more than double that of orange.

I didn't understand it when I looked it up, so please let me know.
Right now, there should only be blue.
If there is, it may just be the old product left.

That's why I don't feel like watching TV anymore...
Does that mean that the comedian has become impossible? Television is full of comedians.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, and there are quite a few scenes where the staff laughs behind me when I'm saying something that isn't particularly funny.
It's obviously not funny, but it's creepy to laugh at everything you say because you're a selling comedian.
But if the staff doesn't laugh, the comedian's mood will be spoiled, and it will be bad for the work relationship.
Like the black companies of the past, that industry is like a sports club, and it seems that some comedians' egos are too big and they have a normal disgusting attitude, otherwise they won't be able to eat.
On the other hand, there are a lot of comedians who say "don't lick the comedian" every time they feel like they are exaggerating the difficulties of their work.
I know that the income is quite small until it sells, but even if people say that comedians are at the top of the list of jobs that are not good at work.
It sounds like nothing more than a glorification of one's own careers and justification for the fact that the laughing entertainers have too high a position in the media and society.
To be honest, the industry I work in is quite tough, but I feel that things that touch the comedian world are becoming more and more impossible.
I'm sorry for complaining.
I felt like it wasn't good for my body if I didn't let it out like a fart ...

Mail order of Ikemoto Brush Industry
Hairbrushes available!
Purchasers will receive a sample
The product I ordered at the TSUKUMO Net Shop was replaced without permission.
Summary: I ordered a cheap wireless mouse and received a wired version of the mouse and was told to send it back if I wanted a refund.
It's more of a mail order trouble than a topic of self-made PCs, but I'm not convinced no matter how you think about it, and it's a famous place, so I'll write it here.
It started when I discovered that MSI's wireless gaming mouse was selling for 3,280 yen at the Tsukumo Net Shop's Tsukumo's Day sale that started the previous Friday.
At the store, the wired version had the same price, so when I checked the wired version page in consideration of the possibility of a price error, it was 5,071 yen (link destination fish taku), so I ordered it thinking that it was not a mistake.
I received an order email successfully, and I also received a shipping email the next day.
In these two emails and in the purchase history of My Page, the name "CLUTCH GM41 LIGHTWEIGHT WIRELESS" was written on it.
Since there was no notification of mistake or cancellation between order and shipment, I thought at this point that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive.
This is the problem, and a few hours after shipping, I received an email saying that there was a mistake in registering the product.
According to that email
* The wireless version was sold at a sale bargain, but it was actually a wired version
* Since we have already shipped a wired mouse,
1. Refuse to receive and cancel all
2. Return only the mouse and refund
3. Use the wired mouse as it is
Choose your response
The product pages of the wired version and the wireless version are separated, and the purchase history, email, and delivery note say wireless version, but it seems that they replaced it with the wired version without permission and sent it.
Isn't it terrible that if you send something different from the product you bought without your consent, and you want a refund, you should return it from here?
Even if I finally accept a refund, I want to fight back with one shot, so please lend me your wisdom.

Twice isolated... Typhoon and heavy rain spill the only bridge leading to the district Residents triple their food stockpiles <Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture> (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo! News
Yoshiro Matsumoto from the Kochihara district of Yamatsuri Town, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 east-Japan typhoon had a major impact on the lives of eight people in three households.
Yoshiro Matsumoto : "At first, I was like, 'Seriously.'
I wondered if it would break so easily, or if it would be washed away." The Takachihara Bridge, the only road leading to the highland area, was washed away by a typhoon Japan east, leaving 30 people from 11 households in the area isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off the water supply continued to carry necessary supplies using the JR iron bridge, which is usually not allowed to pass.
Yoshiro Matsumoto : "Normally, cars would come to the garden, but when I got out of the car there, I would walk over the iron bridge with my hand or on my back, so I felt the appreciation of transportation and cars." The temporary bridge, which was completed one month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months and was isolated again for several days until a temporary bridge was built.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Matsumoto continues to take measures that make use of the lessons learned.
Yoshiro Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
For the time being, I would like to somehow secure enough for 2~3 days." We have prepared about three times as many foods that can be used as emergency food, such as canned food and cup noodles, compared to before the disaster.
Misako Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's problem, and you never know when a disaster will strike you, so I felt again that it would be better for everyone to stockpile a little." On the other hand, Yamatsuri Town experienced an "unexpected disaster" in which a bridge was washed away.
In order not to forget the lessons learned, the town started its own initiative in 2021.
Ryuichi Takahashi, Chief of the Education Division, Yamatsuri Town: "We have designated it as 'Yamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day' and have announced that October 12 will be a day to think about disaster preparedness from next year onwards.
I think there is a greater awareness of the possibility of unexpected things happening than ever before."
Articles at the time of purchase
The test itself is almost finished, so all I have to do is write a sentence, but I am also doing a follow-up test to see if the measurement is correct, so please wait a little.
I can understand that you will not be confident in the measurement results.
If it hadn't been for the Olympics in China, do you think Hanyu's ranking would have changed?

Be careful when buying a second-hand house!
What are the pitfalls of the "Building Condition Survey System" (Diamond Online) - Yahoo! News
● Newly established "Building Condition Survey" system to revitalize the second-hand housing market Existing house transactions are doing well.
Prices of both detached houses and condominiums are rising, and the renovation market is expanding.
While the Corona disaster has increased the desire to own a house, the popularity of properties represented by words such as "in front of the station, near the station, directly connected to the station", "large-scale" and "tower" that are soaring prices is concentrated, and the number of relatively cheap new properties has decreased sharply.
However, compared to overseas, the share of existing (used) home distribution in Japan remains at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) partially revised the Building Lots and Buildings Transaction Business Act and started a survey called inspection, a so-called inspection, for the purpose of trading safe and secure existing houses (https: / /www.mlit.go.jp/common/001219900.pdf).
This is a system in which architects who are familiar with housing check the current situation and condition of the building, including the deterioration of the property, and present it to the buyer after summarizing it in a report.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
This is because sellers can avoid post-delivery complaints by conducting a property survey before the purchase and sale transaction, giving the buyer a sense of security.
In turn, it will lead to differentiation from competing properties.
On the other hand, for the buyer, it is a system that allows them to grasp the condition of the second-hand house they plan to purchase and purchase it with satisfaction, and at first glance, it is a system that has great merits.
However, under the current system, the seller mainly has the initiative to investigate the building situation.
In addition, it should be noted that only the notification of the inspection system is now mandatory.
In other words, the real estate business operator in charge of the brokerage is obliged to explain that "we can introduce an architect who will investigate the building condition when brokering the property" or "it is not possible", but the implementation itself is not mandatory.
● Risks of concern due to seller-led inspections On the other hand, turning to overseas, similar systems have already been established in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, where second-hand markets are booming.
In this system, buyers request a building survey from experts called "inspectors" or "building surveyors" at the pre-sale stage of buying and selling a house.
For example, in the United States, 70~90% of existing home transactions are inspected, depending on the state.
In that the "buyer" takes the lead in conducting inspections, the nature of the Japan-type inspection that is mainly "seller" is very different.
The seller tries to show the condition of the building as well as possible and sell as high as possible and quickly.
On the other hand, the buyer wants to examine the contents of the survey and make appropriate repairs to live with peace of mind.
Even with the same inspection, there is a gap in the purpose and thoughts of both sides.
Therefore, the following points have been pointed out as risks of concern regarding the Japan system.
● The scope of government-mandated seller-led inspections is minimal.
Since it is not a detailed investigation, there is a risk of missing a really important defect ● For an inspection company, an intermediary company (seller) that introduces the project in charge can be said to be a customer.
Therefore, there is a possibility that "speculative" inspections may be carried out, such as not reporting unfavorable survey results to the seller.

It was the second time in a year, so I took about a month off and thought lightly that I was going to say goodbye to the trash company, but it was more severe than I thought and I wanted to see that the medicine didn't fit, so it dragged on.
Anyway, it is important to see a psychiatrist and have it dealt with correctly, and to leave a history of hospital visits (super important).

Synonymous with the downtown area that created "○○ Ginza" in various places in Japan, "Ginza" in Chuo Ward, Tokyo.
In the first place, "Ginza" refers to a silver coin foundry, and in 1612 (Keicho 17), the Ginza Office located in the current Shizuoka City was moved to Edo.
At that time, it was called "New Money Exchange Town", but when it moved to Kakikocho, it came to be called "Ginza".
By the way, it is said that the area around Ginza used to be a "peninsula" jutting out into the sea.
Before the Edo period, a cove entered from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and a peninsula called "Edo-maejima" stretched from Japan Bridge to Ginza.
The tip of the peninsula was the current Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he reclaimed the cove and proceeded with the development of the Kyobashi district.
In addition, Ieyasu improved the city blocks and built a trench to develop boat transportation.
They then cut down the soil that had been cut down from the moat and Mt. Kanda to reclaim the cove.
In front of the Tiffany Ginza main store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), there is a stone monument of the "birthplace of Ginza" indicating the former site of the Ginza government office, so if you are interested, why not look for it?
Ginza's "pilgrimage" known only to those in the know
In Ginza, a "pilgrimage to the sacred place" known to those in the know called "Ginza Hatcho Shrine Tour" is held every year.
Among the more than 10 sacred sites, the most visible is probably the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki-za Theatre.
At the shrine that stands on the far right of the Kabuki-za theater, many people visit before and after the performance.
On the other hand, "Ryuko Fudoson" is on the rooftop of Ginza Matsuya, and "Ginza Desei Jizoson" is on Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Ginza Mitsukoshi.
"Hodo Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" are located at the back of the alley and are difficult to notice, but "Toyoiwa Inari Shrine" is known to have been revered by the famous Kabuki actor Ichimura Hazaemon, and the "Success Inari Shrine" at the entrance on the 1st floor of the Shiseido Ginza Building is closed to the public except when visiting Hatcho Shrine.
Some shrines are dedicated to King Fudo and Jizo Bodhisattva, but most shrines use Inari as their deity.
The Inari-sha, which is greeted by foxes in front of the shrine building, was built in a place where there are many farmers to benefit from the "five grains of abundant harvest" where rice is often harvested.
In turn, in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it was said that there were benefits of prosperous business, and the faith spread even in Ginza, the most popular downtown area in the Japan.

Two days ago, I went to the dentist's office because my front teeth were sore and I had a terrible pain like hyperesthesia when I pressed or touched them.

Korea POSCO International acquires Senex Energy in Australia and expands overseas gas field business = Korea news report (WoW! Korea ) - Yahoo! News
POSCO International Co., Ltd. announced on May 12 that it has signed a stock purchase agreement with Senex Energy of Australia and an investment agreement with Hancock Energy to acquire Senex Energy.
Currently, there are still procedures such as approval at the general meeting of shareholders of Senex Energy and approval of the local subsidiary, and the acquisition procedure is scheduled to be completed in March next year.
This is the largest global acquisition and merger (M&A) since POSCO International was integrated into the POSCO Group in 2010.
The total purchase price is 770.9 billion won, of which POSCO International and Hancock Energy decided to invest 50.1% and 49.9%, respectively.
POSCO International explained that it decided to make this acquisition because it believes that demand for natural gas will continue to increase even in the energy transition era, and that blue hydrogen, which is based on natural gas, will divide the market in half along with green hydrogen in the hydrogen market.
The acquisition will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802 Bcf) of natural gas reserves, equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as local onshore gas field operations in Australia.

Originally, February was only the 11th, which was National Foundation Day, but since the current emperor was born in February, the 23rd is a national holiday.

That knee pain, maybe "knee osteoarthritis"! ?
Medical DOC - Yahoo! News
Editor: I've been having ongoing knee pain lately.
What diseases are possible?
Dr. Maruyama: There are various causes of knee joint pain, such as injury, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common among Japan people is "osteoarthritis".
Editor: Does it mean that the joints become deformed?
Dr. Maruyama: That's right.
Originally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which is responsible for softening the impact and smoothing the movement of the joint.
However, due to aging, obesity, and strenuous sports, cartilage can wear out or distort.
As a result, it leads to joint deformity and inflammation.
Editor: Does osteoarthritis develop other than the knee?
Dr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knees, it can also occur in the knuckles and base of the hands, neck, hips, big toes, and hip joints.
However, the most common case occurs in the knee, which is called "knee osteoarthritis".
Editor: What is the structure of joints in the first place?
Dr. Maruyama: A joint is a combination of two bones in an uneven manner.
And the part where these two lines face each other is covered with "articular cartilage", and the area around the joint is wrapped with "joint capsule".
Editor: It's a complex structure.
Dr. Maruyama: That's right.
In the inner layer of the joint capsule there is a tissue called the synovial membrane, which makes joint fluid.
This joint fluid acts as a lubricant and is composed of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
That is why it is said that "hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are good for smoothing knee movements."
Editor: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Dr. Maruyama: Articular cartilage is sticky and elastic, and plays a role in preventing bones from colliding directly with each other.
In other words, it acts like a cushion.
However, if it wears out or distorts, it can deform and inflame the joint, causing pain.
Do you wear pajamas when you sleep?

3 Gambling & Games from the "Kaiji" Series (Real Sound) - Yahoo! News
The gambling manga "Kaiji" series boasts explosive popularity mainly among men.
One of the best parts of this game is the extreme game where you put your life on the line.
[Photo] Just looking at it makes me shudder ... Challenge the steel frame crossing!
Therefore, this time, I would like to verify Kaiji's games that can actually be played or are practiced in the planning video.
■ Numa It is a trap-packed pachinko "swamp" that appeared in "Gambling Breaking Record Kaiji".
In the original story, the high rate of 4000 yen per ball surprised Kaiji.
This "swamp" was equipped with large traps of "Nail Forest", "Movable Objects", and "Three-Stage Clune", and it was almost impossible to conquer.
However, Kaiji used all possible means and finally went on a rough job of placing a plastic tank in a building to subside and tilt the ground, and he succeeded in capturing it.
The "swamp" that appeared in Kaiji actually appeared as a pachinko and is played by many people.
Of course, there is no such thing as "4,000 yen per ball", and the difficulty level is lowered, but you can feel Kaiji.
■ Steel frame crossing At the "Starside Party" held by the rich as a sideshow, the debtors including Kaiji were forced to carry out the steel frame crossing of "human horse racing".
Debtors compete in speed by devising ways not to fall on a thin steel frame installed 10 meters above the ground.
There are 12 participants, and the top two can win prizes, but there are only four steel frames, safety measures are inadequate, and the chances of death are quite high.
This steel frame crossing is dangerous, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, you can experience it very close at the "Eagle Bridge" installed at Rakuten Seimei Park Miyagi, the home of the professional baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles.
This Eagle Bridge has a steel-framed single bridge at a height of 20 meters (equivalent to the 7th floor of the building), and at the end of it, a "sky swing" and a "victory bridge" are prepared and you can walk to it.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Koala Koarashi released a video of walking on the Eagle Bridge on his YouTube account, claiming that "you can experience steel frame crossing in Japan," and it became a hot topic.
■ E-card 2-player card game, "E-card".
A total of 10 cards, one emperor's card, eight citizen's cards, and one slave's card, are used to play separately on the emperor's side and the slave side.
The game is very well made, with the characteristics that the emperor is strong against citizens, citizens are strong against slaves, and slaves are strong against emperors.
Kaiji faces Tonegawa in the play with the strict rule that if he loses, his ears will be cut off.
Despite the great struggle, Kaiji eventually realized that an ear-destroying device attached to his ear, like an earbud, was reading his psychology by sensing and transmitting changes in pulse and body temperature, and he confused Tonegawa by shaving his own ears to the limit and making his body an abnormal value, and won.
E-cards are commercially available and can be purchased on Amazon and elsewhere.
On YouTube, popular YouTuber Hikaru uploaded a video of him competing with Tatsuya Fujiwara, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, with an e-card, which became a hot topic.
■Is it possible to experience the Kaiji feeling?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but it's also true that when you read manga, you just get a taste of the feeling.
Why don't you feel that worldview through the game?
One step towards the New Year, a gentle boost Tora's grand ema at the prefectural Gokoku Shrine|Yamagata Shimbun
At the Prefectural Gokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), where preparations for the New Year are underway, a large ema of next year's zodiac sign "Tora" has appeared.
Students from Tohoku University of Art and Technology, who designed it, visited the shrine on the 11th, and a dedication ceremony was held in front of the shrine.
The shrine has been commissioning original drawings of ema from Geiko University students since the year before last.
This time, the work of Yui Tsuchiya (22), a third-year student, was adopted from among the nine students in the Japan painting course of the Department of Fine Arts supervised by Professor Toshiaki Suenaga.
The Daiema is 3.3 meters wide and the center is about 1.8 meters high.
Mr. Tsuchiya painted it with "the image of cherry blossoms gently pushing your back as you step into the new year."
The tiger stops and looks at the cherry blossoms with the hope that "even in a rapidly changing world, we will have time to enjoy the beauty of nature."
Tsuchiya's design is also depicted on the ema that is distributed to the public.
Kenichi Chiba, 44, of Gonnegi, said, "I think it will help all people overcome difficulties."

Let's think about "Tamano I want to continue living" Proposal to 4 high school students in the city: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | San Desi
What kind of town will Tamano be in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano City are jointly working on a workshop to think about "Tamano that I want to continue living in."
As part of the research and policy proposal project of the Tamano SDGs Future Center, an interim support organization, the real voices of young people will be compiled and proposed to the mayors and others.
"When is it fun?"
In response to the facilitator's questions, students answer questions such as "when you have fun with a lot of people" and "when you are beating the drums."
The first event was held on November 13 at the Sunrise Fureai Kaikan.
Using the "World Café" method, in which 18 high school students and local people talk about "islands" with their own themes, we thought about "interesting towns," "livable towns," and "towns that feel a sense of purpose in life."
Write down each thought on a sticky note and paste it on imitation paper to organize it.
"A town with many young people looks interesting" "Transportation such as trains and buses are indispensable for livability."
We will discuss further to see if there are any commonalities.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but cycling along the beach is attractive," said Tamano Shoko High School, a 18-year-old third-year student.
An 18-year-old third-year student at Binan High School said, "There are few shops and transportation is inconvenient, but it's nice to have a place rich in nature," and by talking with adults, he realized not only the issues but also the charm of the area.
At the second meeting in December, only high school students gathered to organize the contents of the proposals.
The announcement will be made in February next year, inviting the mayor and superintendent of education.
Rie Higashi, president of the center, said, "We hope that it will foster a love for the hometown among high school students and provide an opportunity for young people to take the initiative in community development."

How to find a new way to wind a stall (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo! News
It is an indispensable stall in winter, but do you have any times when the cloth sags around your neck?
After winding, it is good to look in the mirror to adjust the balance, but I sometimes hear people say that they don't know the trick.
If the cloth doesn't clash and if you have a stole that you can roll quickly... When I was thinking, I found something novel.
The stole of the brand "COTTORI" has a long side of about 1 meter, which is more compact than the general one.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Is it so short that it can be wound?"
If you look closely, you can see that the long and thin cut cloth is woven into a single piece, and the whole is a mesh.
The mesh allows the edges of the stall to pass through.
So you can wind and fasten it without tying the ends together.
Very light and warm with fleece material.
This year, gilets (vests) without sleeves are popular even in outerwear, but many people wear them in combination with stoles so that their shoulders do not get cold.
I think it will be convenient to have such a stall.

The Beatles documentary coming to Disney Plus is super interesting
It's called Get Buck, which was directed by Peter Jackson.
It's so raw or like a life-size Beatle that it's so fresh...
It's just before the breakup, so I'm doing gisgis, but it's not the dramatic gisgis I imagined.
Paul, who is troublesome like "I know I'm annoyed, but come on!" while doing his best, George, who is struggling to say "But...", and John, who calmly says opinions and jokes, but is late and unmotivated... Ringo, who plays the role of Nagose, didn't actively say anything, and he sat behind me with a face saying, "I'm in trouble."
We don't hate each other to the point of fighting like that, but there is a certain atmosphere that says, "Well, we can't work together anymore," and it's interesting that the Beatles were like that. It's kind of like the dismantling of legends.
And when the performance starts in such an atmosphere, everyone is really full of talent.
The process of starting with a small phrase and finishing "that famous song" while each other is doing "How about this?" is dangerous.
Especially the moment when the title Get Buck is completed is amazing.
It's amazing that the scene where the humming like a casual hun-hun-hoon gradually becomes that sloppy ♪ ♪ and the lyrics are included is well recorded.
It's amazing that you don't get to see the process of composing like this.
Also, it's natural, but everyone is greasy, so you can be happy just watching the performance scene.
It seems to be only one out of three episodes, but so far I had the impression that the biggest cause of the breakup was the surrounding environment rather than the Beatles themselves.
The four of them complain a lot, but when they start writing songs, it looks like fun, but what about the live place? When it came to the story, it was easy to understand that producers and publicists-like people were saying something like "After all, the Beatles are the best in the world!" and they had already left their hands.
Well, documentaries also have the director's interpretation, so maybe that's what Peter Jackson felt...
Also, it seems that Paul supervises it, so I thought that might be why Paul is rather bad guy-like in many scenes.

Tornadoes frequently occur in the United States, causing major damage Unseasonably warm and strong cold air (Weather News) - Yahoo! News
From the night of Friday the 10th to Saturday the 11th (local time), tornadoes occurred frequently mainly in the southern United States.
Due to the southward movement of strong cold air in what was the warmest on record for this period, the atmospheric conditions became very unstable, and cumulonimbus clouds seem to have developed rapidly.
Warm air flowed in from the southwest into the southern United States, resulting in record-breaking temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on Thursday the 9th and Friday the 10th has risen to nearly 30°C local time.
In this record warmth, a strong cold air of -30°C or lower moved southward around 5500 m in the sky, and an active front was formed due to the large temperature difference, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
Tornadoes appear to have occurred one after another in the vicinity.
The southern United States is originally prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are not many cases of major damage at this time.
Nearly 150 tornado warnings were issued in a single day during the winter, a record high.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported more than 400 tornadoes and gusty winds on Friday the 10th (local time).
This shows that there are two main concentrated areas: the southern line from Kentucky to Texas and the northern line, which includes Illinois.
In Kentucky, the EF scale (improved Fujita scale), which indicates the strength of a tornado, reached EF3, which is the third strongest of the six levels, and it is believed that a gust of wind of around 70 m/s blew instantaneously.
Depending on future investigations, it may be judged to be EF4~5.
In Japan, JEF (Japan version of the improved Fujita scale) is used based on the improved Fujita scale and tailored to the situation of the Japan building.
JEF3, which is equivalent to this tornado in the United States, is quite possible to occur in Japan, and it is at the level of wooden houses collapsing.

US tornado 'largest ever' calls for help in live broadcast from under the rubble (Nikkan Sports) - Yahoo! News
Regarding tornado damage in the Midwest and South of the United States, U.S. President Joe Biden expressed his view on the 11th (Japan time, 12th) with a mysterious face, calling it "one of the largest tornadoes in the history of the United States."
CNN TV and others reported.
Biden emphasized that "as a federal government, we will do everything."
"We still don't know the full extent of the damage, including how many lives were lost," he explained.
The death toll threatened to exceed 100.
Pictured: Residents carrying household items from damaged homes in tornado-stricken Kentucky From the night of the 10th to the early morning of the 11th, more than 30 tornadoes occurred in at least six states, including Kentucky.
There are records of 219 miles (about 350 km) of tornado damage in Missouri and other states in 1925, but CNN weather experts in the United States estimated that this time it was the largest at about 250 miles (about 400 km).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, which was severely damaged, a candle factory that was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas shopping season was also severely damaged.
At that time, 110 people were on duty, but the building was destroyed and there was no trace.
In the dark, a woman who was stuck under a 1.5-meter-thick piece of rubble felt the weight of rescuers searching the rubble and called for help via a live Facebook broadcast from her smartphone.
In addition to the cries of a woman calling for help, the live broadcast also included screams and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You," which was apparently sung by another woman while crying to dispel her fear.
Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her five-year-old son after a tornado warning was issued.
"Many people compare it to the sound of a train, but it was a terrifying sound, like something more erupting," he recalled.
A Mayfield Police Department officer said, "We will continue the search until it is no longer necessary.
I don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will be."
In Illinois, at least six people were confirmed dead after a warehouse at Amazon, a major online retailer, collapsed.
Trains have been derailed due to impacts such as detachment, and expressways have been blocked one after another due to the effects of overturning vehicles.
According to U.S. web media, a total of about 400,000 homes are without power, including 130,000 in Tennessee.

If you have a "live-in work" like a ryokan or resort part-time job, you can secure both an address and a source of income, but in the current social situation of the Corona disaster, there seem to be few options.
It seems that there is such a site for the time being ↓,

There is a related search "There is a translation, live-in work", so it seems that there are many such people in my colleagues.
It seems that bank accounts and line contracts can be managed if you only have an address for the first time, but credit cards (and debit cards that can be treated as credit cards) cannot be renewed without an address (because a new card will be sent to the registered address).

There is an old discourse that the way of thinking about the star rating system is different.
While other countries deduct points based on 5 stars, Japan claim that 3 stars are added or deducted as neutral.
At the time of the reference point, there is already a difference of 2 stars, and 4 stars have completely different meanings for "there is a deduction element" and "not a masterpiece but an honorable mention".
If you use 5 stars as a standard, "works with no flaws" and "works of the highest standard in everything" will be equal, so if there is such a tendency, I think it is a flaw in the system that does not present the meaning of the stars, but since such a system is actually operated in such a way, you are saying that you should not give it 3 stars (bad reputation).
So if you try to refute those who advocate this kind of discourse with Steam's two-choice rating, the story will not mesh.

"Fried seasonal fish and fried shrimp caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce" by "hakobune"|Life and Culture|Saga Shimbun News|Saga Shimbun LiVE><
Bento "Fried seasonal fish and fried shrimp caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce"
"hakobune" is a take-out specialty restaurant of colorful bento boxes and deli (side dishes) using plenty of vegetables.
"So that you can enjoy the feeling of a restaurant at home," Takayuki Katsuki (39) and Yumi (38) opened in August last year.
One of the popular bento menus is "Fried seasonal fish and fried shrimp caught in the nearby sea with homemade tartar sauce" (1000 yen).
Fish choose the best of the time in the market.
"The fried shrimp is made as thin as possible so that you can see the texture of the ingredients," says Takayuki, and the plump texture of fried shrimp can be directly understood.
The bento box comes with vegetables to accompany and about four kinds of deli, rice with millet grains, and soup made from Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture.
Vegetables are purchased home-grown in the soba field or at direct sales stores in the prefecture.
The side dishes change depending on the time of year, but Takayuki has trained in French and adds color to the dishes such as lapée and ratatouille.
On the other hand, "it has a relieving taste that you are used to eating" (Yumi), such as a dashi-rolled egg, and it is a blend of Japanese and Western that can be enjoyed by a wide range of generations.
The bento box "Homemade hamburger steak with domestic beef" (1000 yen) is also popular.
From next year, the company will also release the Charcuterie Set, a processed meat product that goes well with wine and other alcoholic beverages.

I happened to see something interesting at Haneda Airport, so I used it.
Ride quality It's not that bad, but it shakes occasionally (not so much that you get drunk)
Speed, naturally slow
Safety I think it's safe because I slowed down when there were people around, and in some cases stopped completely, but I thought it was dangerous in some places.
The gaze around me hurts, it's good to be seen, but it's painful to be seen as if it's in the way.
Overall comment It's not bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It's a pity that it would be easier to use if there were a little fewer people or if you had it close to the edge.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create a dedicated lane so that it would not interfere with other people walking.
However, since it is laid-back, I thought it would be a good ride if there were a little fewer people because you can relax while looking at the scenery.
It was a difficult vehicle unless you have a very patient heart, with the excitement of the near future feeling that this kind of autonomous driving will become mainstream in the future, and the pain of the surrounding gaze is comfortable.
I was damn embarrassed

One man is slashed and escapes on a male motorcycle Attempted murder in Ozai, Saga City on the 12th|Incidents and accidents|Saga Shimbun News|Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25 a.m. on the 12th, a man in his 40s from Fukuoka Prefecture was slashed with a knife by a man who appeared to be in his 30s ~ 40s on the street of Daizai 1-chome, Saga City, and injured his face.
The man escapes on a motorcycle, and the Saga South Police Department is pursuing him as an attempted murder case.
According to the South Police Department, a passerby called 110 saying that they were "fighting."
The man suffered injuries to his left cheek about 10 centimeters long and 1 centimeter deep, but is said to be conscious.
The man who escaped is a skinhead with medium meat.
A knife believed to have been used in the crime was left near the scene.
The man said he had been drinking with several acquaintances, and he suspected that there was some kind of traffic trouble between the pedestrian man and the man on the motorcycle.

A family's long journey to environmental protection in China's frontier (JBpress) - Yahoo! News
(Yuki Kato: Hong Kong Company Find Asia Corporate Consultant) China's vast land area is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the world's largest species of mammals and the third largest species of plants in the world.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity and promote not only environmental protection but also the activities of environmental activists.
Sisapanna in Yunnan Province, located in southwest China, is one such region.
Her younger sister, Lee, is currently active as an actress Sisaphanna is a region bordering both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the "Tai" people, who share their roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The headwaters of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, flow.
Sisapanna Tai Autonomous Prefecture The area of Sisapanna is only about 0.2% of China's total, but it is home to about 25% of wildlife species and 20% of plant species.
This time, we met Mr. Lee Mo-ka, who is engaged in environmental protection activities in Sisapanna, and told us about his activities.
■ I started environmental protection activities with my German husband ― ― It has been 20 years since I started environmental protection activities.
What was the impetus for this?
Ms. Lee: Our environmental protection activity "Tianyan" started its activities in 2000.
It was my husband Josef Margraf.
My husband is from Germany and came to Sisapanna for a joint UN-China scientific project.
It was the only rainforest area in China and boasted one of the most biodiverse areas.
However, on the other hand, economic development was lagging behind.
As a result, large-scale logging of the rainforest has progressed in order to establish industry in the region and to produce rubber, which was previously in short supply in China.
The husband was sent here from Germany to restore natural resources and study biological resources.
He met and married me, who was a reporter here.
― ― Wasn't Mr. Lee interested in nature conservation before that?
Lee: I am from Sisapanna, but I was not interested in the importance of rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
Therefore, I decided to promote the project with my husband without that knowledge.
Sometimes I see people who have an aura even though their faces are not well-formed or particularly tall, why do you think that is?
A popular actor once said.
The aura is not something that comes out with the intention of putting it out.
It is something that comes naturally the moment you feel confident in yourself. And.
I'm sure that person has a strong confidence inside.

I suddenly think, is it detailed to say that the other person's clothes are good or that the color is good?
It's not detailed, is it?
I can see it.
I don't think it's fine.
I've never been told that it's a compliment, so I don't know what you mean.
I guess it was a detailed compliment.
What would you do if Sakura Yokomine confessed to you?
"Sakura-san confessed, my heart is in full bloom, please come here," I replied.
And to get along, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share what I like about each other.
If I want to open a Rakuten Securities account, but I choose not to open a NISA account now, can I open it later when I want to?
If you open it at the same time, the procedure will be completed faster.
Now it takes about a week to complete.
Separately, there is no fee, so we recommend that you open a NISA account at the same time so that you can use it immediately when you want to use it.

【Omakan/Personal Memorandum】 The mod caused CTD in its own environment and took about one and a half months to identify.
Until March, stable data was caused by multiple factors while I didn't have much time to play since GW, and it took a very long time to identify it if I looked it up little by little only on holidays.
Why. NET Script Framework didn't parse the logs (and you'll find out in a few minutes)?.dll some of the errors related to lineage and meshes don't make it to the crash log.
〇 Main CTD timing
* All papyri and. Net Script Framework, a type of logging .dll plug-ins that leaves no footprints.
* When some NPCs are killed / attacks accumulated: Activated in console kill→ Essentials be Gone (SKSE plug-in/ powerofthree's SE update resumed version) OFF * Is there a possibility that this will be wet?
* Basic improvement by turning off kill move setting OFF by PC via →.ini when camera work to activate kill moves for some NPCs: setting conflict related to DAR + Nemesis? However, the number of DAR anime has not reached 10,000, let alone the upper limit.
* (Basic Outdoor) While moving the field + activating some magic (e.g. freezing runes), NPC application setting using SPID in Dirt & Blood v 2.0 (upper right corner of MCM) all OFF and all improvements in 5 consecutive attempts.
Is it due to some actors/NPCs wearing additional armor or body mesh shader settings? Note that the default .ini using SPID in 2.0 has a formatting error, but as a result, the result is the intended result and the premise perk should be applied to the NPC.
At first, I focused on checking the part attack and OnHit-related motion/combat mods (.dll ones), but the result was like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports, at least at the English, German, and French levels.
If there are people who have similar CTD problems in Japanese environment, I thought it might be helpful as a reminder, so I posted it.
Relatively everyone is doing it with the last minute mentality,
People around you don't notice it, not to mention your colleagues, let alone your family.
When I look around, I sometimes think optimistically that this person is doing a good job even though he seems to be struggling.
But maybe he's also mentally on the edge.
I didn't retire in the name of mentality, but I think it was the limit just before retirement.
Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric home-visit nursing - After today's home-visit nursing
I have been receiving home-visit nursing for a long time because I have bipolar disorder, but I have known the nurse (female) at the home-visit nursing station I am currently using for a long time, and I think I have built a very good relationship.
We talk about a lot of things every week.
Of course, they also do what is necessary for medication management (such as packaging), but above all, I was reminded of how important pleasant communication is for people with mental illness.
Today, we talked about gender differences between men and women, or even gender theories lol.
Is it okay to do things like about the sexual desires of men and women, or why she got divorced, or something like that? I also talk about things like that.
Sometimes, I'm cross-dressing.
However, I have heard from acquaintances that in the case of a home-visit nursing station run by a psychiatric hospital, an auntie nurse who can no longer work in the ward comes and only responds to the clerical work, or that an occupational therapist comes to the hospital for home-visit nursing, but gives instructions from above, saying, "This is a medical service."
I use a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare corporation, and I think they are really good nurses who treat Frank on an equal basis with my mental illness.
By the way, she is beautiful lol.
Some of you may be receiving psychiatric home-visit nursing, and some of you may be thinking of receiving it.
Home-visit nursing is very beneficial for people with mental illness.
If your doctor approves of it, you should definitely take it.
And choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, I couldn't get the warp right, so I canceled the contract from here.
I'm sorry for the pun.
I know it's a fake warning, but I was scared when it came out in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There are several things that may be the cause, but for example...
・ I don't know what the person who made it will be displayed on the Japanese
・Language determination problem
・ The browser setting is set to prioritize English.
The rankings in order of the number of occurrences in the number of lotto 6 draws are all odd,
Why is odd numbers hard to come by?
It is strange.
There is an apparent pattern.
It repeats itself or continues.
I became teleworking due to the Corona disaster.
But I can't concentrate on my work at home.
I get sober and touch my phone right away.
Even if you drink coffee, it will not progress easily.
What are you all doing?
I'm doing it without opening up again and concentrating lol.
It's like I'm doing as much as I have to do.
I also touch my mobile phone.
South Korea's hydrogen technology patent, one-fifth of China's... "Delay in Implementation of Hydrogen Economy Roadmap" (Joongang Ilbo Japanese edition) - Yahoo! News
In 2019, the South Korean government announced a roadmap for the hydrogen economy.
By 2022, 65,000 fuel cell vehicles will be widely used (cumulatively) and 310 hydrogen stations will be operated nationwide.
The target hydrogen price was set at 6,000 won (about 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November this year, the number of fuel cell vehicles is only 27% of the target level (about 17,000 units).
The schedule for the spread of hydrogen stations in the core infrastructure is also 38% of the target (about 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilogram is in the 8,400 won range, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It was found that the implementation status of the government's hydrogen economy roadmap is well below the target value.
The Japan Business Federation (Zenkeiren) released a report titled "Current Status and Policy Direction of the Hydrogen Economic Ecosystem" on May 12.
According to the report, most of the core components and materials of the hydrogen industry are dependent on the United States, Japan, and other countries.
Toray (Japan) supplies carbon fiber, the core material for fuel cell vehicles, Kyocera (Japan) supplies platinum catalysts, and DuPont (USA), Gore (U.S.A.), and 3M (U.S.) supply membrane membranes.
The number of hydrogen technology patents in the six leading countries in the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has increased by an average of 14% per year (since 2014).
Korea ranks fifth in the world in the number of patents in the fields of hydrogen production and fuel cells (cumulative total from 2014 to 2020).
However, the Zenkeiren reported, "In fact, six countries account for the majority of the global hydrogen market, which means that they are actually at the bottom of the competition."
The order of patents by country is China, the United States, the EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, China has overtaken the United States to take first place.
In 2020, Korea ranked fourth with 1,033 patents, surpassing Japan (974), but 22% of China (4,721).
The Zenkeiren proposed that hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' with a large tax credit for capital investment and R&D expenses.

I think it's tough if you don't have an address except for daily payments.

And in the past, people were told to look for a wife who was one year older than them, even if they wore golden straw shoes, so I think there were many older wives in the Meiji and Showa eras.

, TV program-style leaflet creation Parliamentary reform underway in Takasu, "report book" of lawmakers: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin electronic edition
Takasu: The town council is working on unique council reforms, such as creating unusual leaflets announcing regular meetings and introducing a "report book" in which townspeople evaluate council members.
The town council election was held without a vote for the third consecutive term, and the aim is to get the townspeople interested.
In order to publicize the Sunday Assembly meeting held on the 12th, about 1,800 new leaflets were distributed in newspaper folds on the 9th.
"Raw Giron from the morning" "Tetsuko's room" "Jin Sawaguchi exploration series" ... .
The leaflet, which was distributed to all households by the town council on the 9th, has words reminiscent of the name of a popular TV show.
Representative Katayamabei, 43, who created the event, said, "I want you to smile and go to Congress."

U.S. Aid Weapons and Munitions Arrive in Ukraine, Troops Training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo! News
(CNN) - U.S. State Department officials reported Thursday that equipment including small arms and ammunition arrived in Ukraine under a security aid program approved by President Biden.
Military aid totals $60 million (about 6.8 billion yen), and the last equipment, including four radars to identify launch points such as mortars, will be shipped to Ukraine at the beginning of the year.
Pentagon spokesman Kirby said the aid included lethal weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile.
The purpose of the military assistance is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities in response to the military buildup of Russian forces around the border with Ukraine.
The U.S. has become increasingly wary of Russian military movements and is in talks with NATO members to plan what to do if Russia invades Ukraine.
President Biden approved arms aid when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the U.S. White House on September 1 this year.
U.S. military aid to Ukraine has reached about $450 million this year.
Since Russia's forcible annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, total aid has amounted to more than $2.5 billion.
The U.S. military also served in training missions for the Ukrainian military.
Last month, it dispatched the Florida National Guard as part of a multilateral joint training program in support of Ukraine.
According to a Pentagon statement, U.S. Special Operations Forces in Europe also play a major role in training and advising Ukrainian Special Forces.
The number of U.S. Special Forces operating in Ukraine has not been disclosed as a secret for the conduct of the operation.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 7, and there were tense exchanges in the situation in Ukraine.
The U.S. is also poised to impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The fate of inheritance and gift tax "review" that "forbids" gifts during life, directly hits Akira Amari, former chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, tax commissioner!
The first feature in the December 18 issue of Diamond Weekly was titled "Talking with Your Family During the New Year Holidays!
It is a gift and last-minute inheritance technique during life".
While discussions on the integration of inheritance tax and gift tax are progressing, the 2022 Tax Reform Charter, which was a concern, was postponed, but in the near future, there is a great possibility that gifts given during life, which is the royal road of inheritance tax measures, will become a "prohibited hand".
How will inheritance rules change?
Along with a direct hit on former Liberal Democratic Party Tax Commission Chairman Akira Amari, Representative of the House of Representatives, we will teach you everything from the basics of gifting and inheritance to tax-saving techniques for gift-making and inheritance for last-minute gifts that will be available by the end of the year.
(Diamond Editor, Hiroaki Miyahara)
● Prohibition of pre-mortem gifts used by everyone from wealthy people to office workers in urban areas "From the perspective of taxing inheritance tax and gift tax in a more integrated manner, we will proceed with full-scale studies to establish a tax system that is neutral to the choice of timing of asset transfer."
A sentence from the ruling party's fiscal 2021 tax reform outline announced last year caused a great deal of unrest not only among wealthy people but also among the middle class.
This is because what he means is to drastically change the rules of inheritance and to raise the inheritance tax by making "gifts during life," which is the royal road of inheritance tax countermeasures, "prohibited."
The iron rule of tax saving measures for highly progressive inheritance tax is to "reduce taxable property".
The strongest trump card, pre-mortem gifts, has been widely used not only by wealthy people but also by office workers who have a home in the three major metropolitan areas and incur a small inheritance tax.
In the midst of this, the discussion of "integration of inheritance tax and gift tax" arose.
Although it was postponed in the FY22 Tax System Revision Outline announced on December 10, which was a concern that it would be introduced at the fastest time, "We will review the current inheritance settlement taxation system and the calendar-year gift system" and "Since the gift tax exemption is a system that does not require any tax burden for the transfer of assets within the family within the limit ... we will constantly review it." The policy for unification was renewed with more in-depth language.
In an interview with this editorial department, Akira Amari, former chairman of the LDP's tax research committee and former secretary-general, said:
"The most important thing is to eliminate the advantages and disadvantages of the timing of the transfer of assets, and to keep the tax burden the same no matter when you do it.
At the moment, we are simulating what kind of problems will arise [through integration]." If the revision is the fastest, there are three remaining chances to give gifts during life.
Even if this is not the case, there is no doubt that in the near future, there will be a major shift in the direction of invalidating pre-mortem gifts as a tax-saving measure.
So, how exactly will the inheritance tax and gift tax rules change?

"My Right Brother" terrestrial broadcast from January 10, 2022 Yudai Furukawa "Please look forward to it!"
It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My Right Brother" starring Yudai Furukawa will be broadcast terrestrial on Fuji TV from midnight on January 10, 2022.
【Photo】Hanajun Yamatani as the heroine Based on the manga of the same name by Satoshi Morie, which was serialized in Kodansha's "BE・LOVE" since 2018, this work is a sad pure love story between a man and a woman who carry the past on their backs.
The main character, Kairi, is served by Furukawa, and the heroine, Riyo, is played by Kasumi Yamatani.
Riyo, a college student, meets Kairi, a senior at her part-time job.
Kairi, who suffers from insomnia every day, is a mysterious young man who can sleep soundly with the help of Riyo for some reason.
Riyo is attracted to Kairi, who has a similar appearance to her brother, who was separated by her parents' divorce, but at some point, Kairi is a murderer, isn't he?
・Yudai Furukawa Comment The drama "My Right Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial waves from January 10th!
I hope that those who could not see it on FOD will look forward to it, and those who have already seen it will be able to learn more about this work if they know the development and see the complex psychological depictions of Kairi and Riyo, as well as the state of the two people struggling and changing.
I hope that fans of the original will also enjoy it.
Stay tuned!

【NFL】Team wins 3 passes per game: What and how did the players feel (BBM Sports) - Yahoo! News
In this game, Jones threw a pass = Patriots only three passes.
It was the fewest passes in the NFL in the past 50 years since the Bills' two passes against the New York Jets in Week 3 of 1974.
In 1974, the Bills had an unsurpassed genius RB named O.J. Simpson who surpassed 2,000 yards in a season for the first time in history the previous season.
The Bills overwhelmed the Jets with Simpson and another RB Braxton run.
The weather was the biggest reason the Patriots deployed such an extreme offense.
Buffalo is a town near the Canadian border, and in terms of latitude, it is no different from Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was almost around 1 degree Celsius, the wind was 18 meters per hour, and there was a snowstorm before the game.
The Bills were local and didn't change their playing choices much.
25 runs to 30 passes.
Allen's pass is 15/30 for 145 yards.
There were no interceptions, and it wasn't a failure.
In 10 offensive series, there were four red zone incursions and scoring opportunities.
Especially after the end of the third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, he only managed to score three runs in those three innings, one FG.
Defending in front of goal in the final game of the match.
Trailing by four points, the Bills committed a penalty at 3rd&9 to make it 3rd&14.
18 yards to the goal.
In 3rd&14, QB Allen flowed out of pocket and to right, surrounded by a rush of Patriots defense.
He then threw a pass to TE Dawson Knox in the end zone, but failed.
On this play, ace WR Stephon Diggs, who was on the outside right, ran on a charo-a-cross to free in front of the end zone, but it didn't seem to catch Allen's eye.
On the 4th&18, Allen aimed for WR Gabriel Davis, who ran in from the outside left into the end zone, but his pass was unsuccessful when he was hit by Patriots' DB Miles Bryant in front of him.
Bryant was covering Bills' WR Cole Beasley one-on-one, but he saw Allen's move midway through the process and released Beasley to react to the pass.
Allen, who overlooked the two receivers, threw passes aimed at the end zone on both occasions.
The pass on 4th down may have been a decisive shot, but on 3rd down, there was no need to aim for a TD.
You just have to take a first down in two plays.
It was still 2 minutes ago, so if I made it 4th & short, Allen's ability to run his own would have been alive.

3 items that tend to be left in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's BAZAAR) - Yahoo! News
sponge
No matter how often you change it, it's probably the sponge that you don't change as often as recommended.
A 2017 study found that kitchen sponges can still grow a lot of bacteria, even if they are sterilized in the microwave every day (although it is still recommended to sterilize them in a microwave).
The German researchers who conducted the study recommend changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
chopping board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture points out that cutting boards should be replaced when they begin to wear and scratches and grooves form.
This is because once a wound or groove progresses, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria multiply.
If you're still okay, don't forget to disinfect frequently with a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach in 1 gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Immerse the surface of the cutting board in the liquid and leave for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and drain and dry as if to dry naturally or pat with a clean paper towel.
Chipped or broken tableware
Getting rid of your favorite mug can be heartbreaking, but the chipped surface becomes a new breeding ground for germs and bacteria.
It can also cause the lip to be cut off in the missing part and the drink to spill.
Yes, it's your chance to buy your new favorite mug!

Help FlashBIOS Won't Finish
I bought a Ryzen7 5800X and replaced it with the B550 I bought in September and my phone.
I went to the BIOS setting screen once, but when I saved the settings and restarted, the white cursor-like dot did not blink on the black screen and it was accepted all the time.
Even if you think that the BIOS is corrupted and try to rewrite using FlashBIOS, it does not end at all.
According to MSI's blog, it takes about 5 minutes, but it doesn't end even in 1 hour.

For some reason, I'm embarrassed to have a branded product.
If it is inconspicuous, you can have it, but you can't have it written as Lv in monogram like Vuitton.
Why?
I think it's good that it suits your length.
By the way, if it's Japan, I think it's good.
If Japan, then. Are.
It has nothing to do with Gaijin-esque.
You should say as soon as possible, "Why are you calling me alone?"
And it doesn't matter because you're a foreigner? If that happens, you should simply say that it is uncomfortable.
I don't think I've ever dreamed that I'm uncomfortable with a decent probability.
I was living abroad on the way, but Japan people who went outside misunderstood that there were a few people who came because they didn't like the Confucian customs up and down, including me, and that they could say anything to the locals because they had come off the tag.
If you look like a Westerner, I think you are doing it with a kind of spoiled or friendly feeling, not pure malice.
If my friends are from the West, I call them by their first names, but sometimes when I talk to them in Japanese, I am a little confused about which one to choose.
Well, if you're a friend, it's still good.
I guess I'm just doing it purely normally, but if I overlook it, I may not be able to stop the exceptional treatment of Gaijin, so it's better to say it now.
Japan So why don't you talk to me by the rules of Japan?
Henshu: It doesn't matter, but my naturalized white friends always raise their glasses higher than other younger people when they toast at drinking parties.
I'm definitely conscious of it, but I think it's a good habit because if you do it that way, you won't be strangely slandered by younger or older people Japan or you will be treated like a person.
Because there are people (including me) who look at such details regardless of their personality Japan

Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, the number of subscribers was 25 as of yesterday, so I thought it would take a little longer until 50 people came, but for some reason, 25 people subscribed today alone, so I am very grateful.
If you subscribed to this sable today, I would appreciate it if you could tell us where you found out about this sable in the comments section! (I'm really worried because I don't recognize it)
I am the only person who is currently making a thread, so I would appreciate it if you could set up a thread.
It would be encouraging if you could comment even if you don't make a thread.
Maybe there are few people who use Reddit but Twitter.
If you use Twitter, please set up a thread!
Last but not least, thank you very much! The sable I made before didn't attract as many people as I wanted and I was immediately frustrated, but this time it seems that I can continue without frustration thanks to everyone.
We will do our best to maintain the wiki and rules and make the sable easy to use, so thank you for your continued support!

Has it accumulated in Tokyo?
Well, please flush it into the water!
I only have the ability to understand a little English, so I judge only by the translated text.
I think the translated text is at a level where you feel a little uncomfortable with the text, but you know what you want to convey and it doesn't interfere with the amount of play (I think it's better to ask other people if you just feel this way).
I often see this level of translation in games made overseas, and I feel that if you are a small company, you are translated well.
I think that the reason why people who are not Japanese native speakers understand the difference between the fine nuances of Japanese is whether they can reach it even after studying for a long time.
I don't know what level you're looking for, but if you're looking for a level that Japan doesn't feel uncomfortable with, you might want to look elsewhere.

Consideration "Demon Slayer" training is the battle.
"Equivalent Exchange of Effort" is a human hymn<anime "Yukaku-hen" start commemorative > (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo! News
Among recent shonen manga, Demon Slayer is particularly different from Demon Slayer, which is that there is a lot of training.
It is a well-established theory that there are no battles for the most part, and that training editions that train both day and night are not popular with readers.
This is evident from the fact that in the same jump manga "ONE PIECE", when the Straw Hat Pirates were separated, there was a two-year training, but they only drew touches and boldly skipped the rest.
Well, one of the attractions of Wangpi is the eccentricity of the land you move to, and "staying in the same place and training" may not be so compatible.
By the way, the training of Tanjiro, the protagonist of "Demon Slayer", sat down with Yoshiyu Tomioka, who saved his life, and begged for the life of Nezuko, who tried to take his own life, and said, "Don't let others hold the right to kill and rob! ! " It can be said that it started with what I was told by a volunteer.
The weak have no rights or choices, they are only screwed down by the strong by force . . .
While saying that, it was Yoshiyu's kindness that introduced Sakonji Kitaki, a "nurturer" who trains those who wish to join the Demon Killing Squad (he is also a poor communicator who does not explain his intentions).
The first contact between Tanjiro and Otaki is when he is asked, "What do you do when your sister eats people?", and Tanjiro, who is stuck in the answer, says "Judgment is slow".
It's a seemingly unreasonable exchange that even among fans.
However, taking his sister with him who has become a demon may lead to a moment when he will be forced to make such a decision.
It can be said that it is an initiation to enter training from a mental attitude.
However, Tanjiro, an amateur who has not yet trained, takes him to Sagiriyama and tells him to descend to the foot of the mountain by dawn.
The mountains are thin and full of pitfalls, stone throwers, and traps, and you will die before you can start training.
Even so, with his keen sense of smell, he can smell the faint scent of a trap set by human hands, and barely manages to avoid it.
Still, "That doesn't mean you're suddenly so physically capable that you can avoid it all of a sudden! !" What makes Tanjiro say that is the essence of what makes demon slayer a demon slayer.
Ordinary humans don't suddenly become stronger without any backing, and awakening only allows them to use the "power and skills they have honed so far" to their original potential.
The "equivalent exchange of effort" that rewards those who put in the effort and nothing for the effort they don't make is a different human anthem from demons who can have unfounded supernormal powers, and it is an immovable rule that is consistent with this work.
Is this old?
It is still a way of sleeping that is not a bed, but a mat directly at the house, and you sleep on a mattress or comforter.
Because the house is not a condominium.
I do that too.
If you want to use a large room, it is better to sleep on a futon than on a bed.
I think there are a lot of people like that.
Will it be frustrating?
Are people who work part-time and want to work full-time and work in conjunction with other stores hard?
No, I don't particularly think so.
In that case, it doesn't fall under what I think is "stiff".
I think that it is "hard" to plan to somehow get more profit than effort with minimal effort.
Do you have smoking cessation clinics nationwide now?
I do it everywhere.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics Establishes a "DX Division" that integrates home appliances and mobile devices, "emphasizing the user experience" ( WoW! Korea ) - Yahoo! News
Following the integration of the CE and IM divisions as a set division, Samsung Electronics announced on the 12th that it has decided to name it DX (Device eXperience) and will reflect this in the organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
Through a variety of services ranging from mobile to home appliances, the aim can be read as to enhance the user experience.
Samsung Electronics revealed that the newly formed DX division by merging the CE and IM divisions will consist of divisions such as VD (Visual Display), Home Appliances, Medical Equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and Network.
An official from Samsung Electronics explained, "This name change reflects the medium- to long-term business structure, future-orientation, and strengthening of global leadership."
It also emphasized the company's intention to make it easier for consumers to enjoy optimized experiences through services and solutions that reflect customer needs, as well as products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communication equipment.
The name also reflected the strategy of creating synergies on a company-wide scale and building a foundation of differentiated products and services on the occasion of the launch of the integrated leadership structure.
Samsung Electronics is already envisioning a strategy through the Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council to enable users to freely use content and services through interconnection between devices, such as home appliances and smartphones based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI).

It's a matter of taste, but I don't think "DESU/MASU Style" fits a natural science documentary narrated by a man with a low voice.
I would like to see the expression heavier and more formal.
> They lie, jaws primed, with only their armoured heads visible from the sand... anything that stumbles into their pit is speared and dragged below.
> Larva ambush in the sand to capture prey at any time, showing only its discoid head from the sand.
It's a bit unnatural here.
The larva of the leopard ambushes in the sand so that its prey can be caught at any moment, and only its disc-shaped head peeks out of the sand.
I think it should be.
What I'm worried about is
* Did you refer to other documentaries?
* Are you looking at it from the ant's point of view?
Is it?
If you translate armoured heads as a disk-shaped head, I think the part that says "On the scale of an ant, it is a giant beast wearing a helmet" disappears ...
Aichi 24 cars collided, trailer driver has no chronic illness (TV Asahi (ANN)) - Yahoo! News
In an accident in which 24 cars collided in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, it was found that the driver of the trailer that was arrested and sent to the prosecution did not have any chronic illness and seemed to have caused the accident due to some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, and 12 people were slightly injured.
Police arrested Katsuya Nomura (54), who was driving a trailer, on suspicion of first causing a rear-end collision and injuring a 71-year-old man, and sent him to the prosecution on the morning of the 12th.
Nomura's trailer continued to move forward without applying the brakes after the accident, and the fire department confirmed that Nomura temporarily lost consciousness immediately after the accident.
However, according to investigators, Nomura did not have any pre-existing medical conditions and was likely caused by some kind of carelessness.
Police are raiding the people involved and taking a closer look at the situation.

Oginuma X no Kinnikuman Review [Comics Volume 4] ( Weekly Pre-NEWS ) - Yahoo! News
The 20th Superhuman Olympics, which began with three volumes, is completed in these four volumes!
In contrast to the previous volume, which depicted everything from the opening to the semi-finals at once, it is full of new gimmicks because it focuses only on one match!
- [Kinnikuman] Volume 4 Review Poster Name Oginuma X★★★★★ (5 out of 5 stars) - Superhuman Pro Wrestling has already started even before the match!
In a nutshell, these four volumes are a carefully and carefully depicted final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but the first thing to keep in mind is that they are by no means just about matches in the ring.
Starting with the signing ceremony, the battles between each other and the special training scenes have changed from the past, but it is not boring at all.
This feeling in the work, in which the tension of the battle of the century finally begins, gradually increases, and it definitely leads to a heightened tension among the readers, and even this period is a truly calculated production.
And before the important final, one more thing you can't miss is the third-place match between Terryman and Ramenman.
In addition to the luxury of the match card, what I like is that before the match, Ramenman said to the Kinnikuman poster, "Now it's my turn! ! 」
and try to slam the chop.
However, Terryman, who happened to be passing by, catches the sword and blocks it, stares at each other silently, and the scene separates with just that.
What's amazing about this is that both of them have already been eliminated and there is no chance to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament anymore.
But there is such a thing of agony over that Kinnikuman.
If I were to be shown something like this, I couldn't help but think about their activities in the distant future!
This is what it means for a character to stand up, and as a manga artist, this is an act that still makes me keenly aware of this!
The fight between the two does not take much time, but the famous scene is Ramenman's tearful appeal after the match.
"Don't just rely on the strength of God's luck! ! 」
That's the line.
This is already a grand meta statement about the work itself, and I think that readers have felt that Kinnikuman is not defeated because he is the main character after all, and that he has somehow won in areas where he is not his ability.
But by having Ramenman make this statement, Boiled Egg Sensei took the lead and nailed that he couldn't use that hand anymore.
With this one word, the reader thinks, "Oh, so Kinnikuman is going to defeat Robin with his ability?
How? 」
The uncertain development will stir your imagination again, and if you look at it from the artist's point of view, this is a line that is as if the teacher who created the work imposed a bind on himself.
I thought you did a great job.
I think it's definitely one of the major points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend Takahama-cho Aobayama (Fukui Prefecture) ( FBC Fukui Broadcasting ) - Yahoo! News
At the Aobayama Herbal Village in Nakayama, Takahama Town, the first winter illumination has begun, and the park is enveloped in gentle light.
(December 12) The winter illuminations, which began on November 26, are sprinkled with 50,000 LED bulbs along the walking paths and lawns, including a 20-meter-high camphor tree.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I came to Fukui for the first time in a long time, and I was surprised that there was such a place.
It's so beautiful and I was relieved."
The illuminations were first planned to help people feel soothing while avoiding crowds, and are lit from 5 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays until December 25.
In addition, on the last day, the 25th, as a Christmas event, there will be a behavior of button pots and a movie screening.
I think the number of people who can read the documents in order is limited.
I had a friend who could read a lot, and when I asked him, he was a person who could do it, but he had solidified it steadily from the basics of Linux, and I read it from the point of interest by reading the table of contents in a reference book rather than a document.
(In fact, it is easier to apply and understand if you learn from Linux than by suddenly touching something as abstract as docker.)
It's quite hard to pull that out and suddenly understand everything.
I wish I could figure it out...
You don't have to do it in order.
Also, instead of memorizing the contents, he seems to remember only the things that he skipped before and read them when necessary.

This morning I had a misfortune...
The NAS PC no longer turns on🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
〜What happened~
1.) Open the window in the morning for ventilation.
At this time, the PC is energized.
2.) When I returned to my room after a while, I noticed a sound like a pink rotor from the PC and shut it down for the time being.
At this point, it was thought that the fan movement was only deteriorating due to the room temperature drop (6°C).
So I decided to warm up the room and try again.
3.) Without booting.
When the power button is pressed, the power lamp turns on for a moment and the fan works, but it stops immediately.
After that, I don't say yes or no.
I unplug the power plug and try again, but it still sticks for a moment.
4.) Connect only the motherboard to ATX 20 pins and 4 pins, remove the other parts and try but it does not start.
5.) I suspect that the PSU is the cause because the PSU fan has been hitting something for a long time and there has been a buzzing sound.
Find a surplus ATX power supply at a later date and try it.
Probably.
If not... What should I do.
Change the case and mother together or ...
