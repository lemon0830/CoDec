From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac's age on the basis of their interests.
Of the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those very ladies of Balzac's age.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were plush to depict a certain variety of them?
There are roses of this color and with such a petal structure, resembling velvet, as a rule, dark red, burgundy tones.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Model "Micropackage Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different stiffness of the sides: a medium-hard surface is formed by latex coconut fiber and natural latex, a moderately soft surface is formed by a slab of natural latex.
A spring unit with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeper's body, preventing the appearance of a "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, breathable materials should be highlighted.
Latex perforated for breathability is perfectly ventilated naturally, as is coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate of the bed is maintained.
Also, the mattress is covered by an extended warranty period.
The term of the official warranty from the manufacturer is 5 years, in fact, the service life of the mattress is longer.
Protection against dust and dirt is entrusted to the removable jacquard cover supplied in the kit.
Pair the mattress with an orthopedic pillow - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

Andrey, they clearly explained to you that pensioners work in schools, they will not work on the command line.
A computer science teacher will not be able to help either, he was not taught this, the schoolboy plays games of Windows.
So there is no support.
I remember with horror these feasts and guests at my parents' house.
Guests are on the doorstep, and the cutlets are still fried on the stove, mom is disheveled on the floor.
Lord, yes, I sat down at the table already exhausted.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday you drag food, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning after.
And what about the guests?
They feel good, and be sure to have a cake with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I set the table at the minimum wage.
And I cook sweets for them, I bake very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccination is imminent
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will probably be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
On Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination against coronavirus can be carried out "in combination with flu vaccination."
This will help you achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help combat the spread of the new Omicron strain of coronavirus.
Moreover, the new variant is especially dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than that of the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech / Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain," BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, advocates shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience shows this very convincingly," the expert stressed.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21Â®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibs in that it was originally created with ice fishing in mind, and not just for catching back-to-back.
These vibes have a greater specific gravity than analogues similar in size, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing in a plumb line, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the movement of the rod up and down with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a confined space littered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles that can be hooked.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for pike perch and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a point and aggressive supply of bait is required.
Upon reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is no less successfully used for winter fishing for pond trout.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib with a plumb line game is able to tease a passive pike that does not even react to live bait.
When catching back-to-back, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it goes well with fishing line and braided cords of even large diameters.
For catching pike, pike perch, ruff or perch, in addition to uniform, the "step" is also relevant, sometimes with a "chirp" along the bottom.
If you are fishing in squiggled places, you can change the front tee to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of hooks.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
With equal success it can be used both in relatively shallow and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers sit on the neck of old parents.

In Libya, announced about 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the Wagner private military company (PMC) in Libya.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
"Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabia air bases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to seize" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain Presence
According to the interlocutor of the publication, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya."
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, uses an air base and port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, the agency's publication notes.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else can mercenaries be?
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine African countries - the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders, and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries.
According to the media, the "Wagnerians" allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group does not appear either in law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not in the formulary lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
It is expected that this decision will be approved by the Council of the European Union on December 13.
The situation in Libya
Libya's Supreme Council of State is the de facto second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with Islamists dominating it, TASS writes.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for the elections of deputies of parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing," the article says.
Against this background, the High Electoral Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures prevail.
"Examples of successes are "in Syria they defended, restored peace there", "the decision on Nord Stream 2", "the whole world was intimidated that cool weapons", "we squeezed out Crimea".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world," the study of the Public Opinion Foundation says.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paperwork - all public services have also become only digital
The government of Dubai announced a complete abandonment of paperwork and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This was reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marked the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government," Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of the Emirate, Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, said on Saturday.
From now on, internal and external document flow in all government agencies in Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all industries without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document management began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary terms.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, about the dates of birth and how old the child is, this is already insanity, about the class and the group in kindergarten too.
Well, I don't believe that there are such molesters.
And if they do, then they obviously don't care about anything, including the family.
My mother, her two brothers and grandparents lived on 3 Vladimirskaya, there was 1 floor without bars.
They knocked first on the door, then on the window, then decided not to stand on ceremony, broke the window and climbed in, but my grandfather had a baseball bat, which they received.
These people knew for sure that there was someone at home...
Turkey's car production and exports fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid a depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's performance in the first 11 months was worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were produced from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year's figure.
And if in the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector in Turkey showed a positive trend compared to last year, then in the first 11 months of 2021, car production was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which fell by 29% against the dollar in November.
This led to a drop in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferral of loan payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation with the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, Kazinform reports.
"According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, in pursuance of the instructions of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, Order No. 127 of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 "On approval of the Procedure for granting deferred payments on loans to small and medium-sized businesses" was adopted," Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferred payments on loans provided for the provision by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities of deferred payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME.
The borrower's application could indicate a different period for deferred payments.
During the period of deferral, the claim work, notification of the need to repay overdue debts, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the lender were suspended in relation to the borrower," the deputy prime minister said.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for deferred payments on loans from 603 borrowers-SMEs, of which 553 SMEs received a deferral in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SMEs applied for a deferral to MFIs, of which 95 entities were granted a deferral in the amount of 105.8 million tenge," Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the Okmiron strain
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the okmiron strain of coronavirus can be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunocompromised person.
That is, when mutating, he did not meet any resistance from immunity.
Due to this, it is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than it should be, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "Okmiron" more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
So it happens with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-old young people die, and 60-year-old people endure it in the form of a sneeze.
The immune response is frenzied in a young person, it is completely inadequate: where it was only possible to shake a finger, it hits sparrows like a cannon, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs can be bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, it is often possible to stop only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - this is fever, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year, the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old can begin to be vaccinated.
Pavel Volchkov, virologist and head of the MIPT Laboratory of Genomic Engineering, noted that this category is very actively affected by covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, as well as kindergarten pupils," Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the MIPT Laboratory of Genomic Engineering, told Moscow 24.
Many thanks to the author for this article.
I was happy to refresh my memories...
Teath-In.
In those distant seventies and eighties, not a single dance floor could do without the melodies of this group.
And at home, gathering with friends, they danced to their music.
Immunologists have hypothesized why obese people fall victim to covid
The authors studied adipose tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes can become infected with coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system's response.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of this.
The biologist spoke about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty navigating even in a familiar environment.
Golosheikin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins most often lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
This includes hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role," he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by addictions - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disturbances and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Formerly, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Russian National Research Medical University.
Anna Bogolepova, Head of the Department of Cognitive Impairment at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30 thousand artifacts illegally exported from the country
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return to their homeland about 30 thousand artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the air of the Al-Hayat TV channel, the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gaouad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Goouad clarified that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Now the staff of the department is working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural values are restored, and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at auction in London.
Auction house Christie's on July 4 held an auction at which a bust over 3 thousand years old was sold for $ 5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak Temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient monuments illegally exported from the country at different times.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and rightly so, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazan) live in the Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline until which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the hardest for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is already outside of any literary associations, spat with imagism, he is on his own, but he is famous, in demand, at times strongly scolded by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their arms.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Soviet Russia" was published.
And the main success - at the end of June 25, the State Publishing House concluded an agreement with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the contemporary poets Sergei Alexandrovich was honored with such an honor, he was the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter Sofia Tolstoy, it was necessary to equip family life, support sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life was getting better, there is something to rejoice, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark colors, as if a nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Whether the wind whistles
Over an empty and deserted field,
Like a grove in September,
Alcohol showers the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had passed badly, looked bad, and was clearly ill.
Increasingly, sprees, nervous breakdowns are repeated.
And the reason, probably, is not only in alcoholism ...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
For example, relating to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (Yesenin would come to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But there are plenty of testimonies of the poet's binge drinking, scandals on this basis, drives to the police - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrible romance with the green serpent has developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, the imagist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he was found in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
Startsev recalls:
"He came only to spend the night, and in most cases in a deranged, drunken state.
Once, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing ...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
When he came to his senses a little, he began to cough continuously, sprinkling blood all over the sheet ...
And Yesenin himself, after a voyage to Europe and the United States (there was prohibition in the States at that time, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her), admitted:
"I didn't see anything there, except taverns and streets ...
At the end, I stopped remembering people ...
Well, he drank, of course ...
And I drank because the melancholy gnawed.

Now my son is almost 16, and he has not been tormented by the desire to fool for a long time.
All energy is directed to choosing what he will do for a living.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who periodically had problems with the law until the wedding.
A father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "with a strange love."
Why did the girl burst into tears at the exam when she had not yet failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't a school?
Well, she will have a tail.
So what?
Retake.
Millions of students know this.

The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a "weapon"
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Yablonski expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The corresponding statement was made by the Deputy Foreign Minister in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus temporarily "stopped Lukashenka," but he "is actively looking for new ways."
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will be used as a weapon "in many parts of the world."
As the kp.ru website wrote, earlier the European Union put into effect the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they declared their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve."
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not according to Senka's hat": when a velvet jacket makes a laughing stock out of a man
Social events in 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die," he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional Bond bow tie.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not correspond to the royal dress code at The Earthshot Prize award ceremony, and then chose a more classic version for an event in support of the Royal Variety charitable foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messiah tried on the trend.
The footballer came to pick up the seventh Ballon d'Or in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already noting the growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received by the "Gazeta. Ru", they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and fitted silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
There are budget options in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are presented in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which brand ambassador Jared Leto came to one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci".
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of weaving threads, a dense fabric with a fleecy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but relevance.
"Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a special event," explains Vakhoshkin. - It is also suitable for those cases if the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie" is indicated in the invitation.
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, must acquire the right advanced party with prosperity," the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammell" believe. - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed social events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with arrows, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Handsome Brummel" are sure: the appearance of an ordinary employee in a velvet jacket at a corporate party will also be inappropriate, but if we are talking about "a leader from among those who run this event, then "yes", he has such a thing in the subject.
If the employee is of a lower rank, and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate this with the phrase "not according to Senka's hat," the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe.
Very ambiguous sensations from the voice.
This is an unnatural timbre, it pulls so torturedly.
And it is not at all associated with the cute face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But from the bottom of my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, it is paid for.
Billions of dollars in investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy is also not at a loss - gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are now selling.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
A pretty penny drips.
And then who is in flight?
As usual - an ordinary buyer.
Do the problems of the Indians touch the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good bribe.
I did not see a single beautiful person in the pictures in the article.
Just mediocrity within the average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will most likely not sit down with them.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "handsome men", but definitely not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave position and fights against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who is unconscious of his slavery and vegetates in a silent, unconscious and dumb slave life is simply a slave.
A slave who salivates when he smugly describes the delights of slave life and admires a good and good master is a slave, a boor.
The immunologist said that revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the Omicron strain of coronavirus
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination in six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period."
"With previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases in four," the expert said, urging in parallel with the vaccination campaign to engage in revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has been given two vaccinations and a booster, or he has been ill and vaccinated, or has been vaccinated and has been ill, then he has received "hybrid immunity", that is, there are a lot of antibodies and there are enough neutralizing ones," the expert said.
The Group of Seven warned Russia of "large-scale consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
The countries of the "Big Seven" (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will cost dearly" to Moscow, but the document does not describe specific measures.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine," the statement said.
Further, the ministers call on Russia to weaken
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve the full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in response," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained stance.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Truss, said that Russia would suffer "serious consequences" in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed "the united voice of the Group of Seven countries, which account for 50% of world GDP, and who made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia."
The Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective against the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug for COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, however, this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kyiv
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksiy Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kyiv's acquisition of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to destroy drones.
At the same time, it is noted that Berlin later softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as a non-lethal weapon.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the aforementioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect Berlin to supply weapons under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will retain the same "illogical" position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kyiv expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine expects that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

But apart from hatred, gossip, scandals, there is not much to remember.
I feel sorry for her, she lived her life in anger.

The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of the Russian armed forces near the country's borders.

Disclosed ways to return money stolen through online stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
So, to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data falls into the hands of intruders, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be saved in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen while shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, you can start the refund procedure.
"Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure, the responsibility rests with the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service," the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
Artur Zaremba, an expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, stressed that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be protested and the money can be returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, Ekaterina Mizulina, a member of the Public Chamber and director of the Safe Internet League, said that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand complaints were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of forged documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz has stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for years to come, the leaders of the two countries have expressed unequivocal expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany, bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains a cause for controversy.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national law took precedence over EU rules.
Germany's new government, sworn in on Wednesday despite demands from Poland and the United States, has made no public commitment to halt Nord Stream 2 in the event of a Russian invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm these reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, a position confirmed on Sunday by representatives of the Group of Seven.
Dmitry, take a closer look.

And I know such apartments very well and I can see perfectly well how it was replanned.
May everything be fine with them.
It is always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, toilet, window sills, taps.
You wash them once a year at Easter, which you have to wash directly.
Just don't let it get dirty.

There are citizens who, a week before vaccination, by their own decision, begin to take anticoagulants.
And during a preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruising.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found the money in the wall of the church will be paid 20 thousand dollars
A plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will be rewarded.
This was reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that devout Christians will face wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was repairing one of the church's toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under the insulation.
He handed over the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you have done and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
Apparently, the find is related to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer losses.
Nevertheless, for information about the criminals, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was announced.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount as the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated five thousand dollars for the award and later received another 20 thousand dollars as a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the honesty of the plumber.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned Pastor Joel Osteen about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person."

It is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also on the list of exceptions are persons arriving from countries where the absence of the vaccine has been proven.
"The situation is even more serious when you consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist traffic," Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities ordered tourists who were not vaccinated against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
A scheme for full protection against COVID-19 has been disclosed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein, in an interview with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme for complete protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by administering an injection and using a nasal vaccine.
With internasal use, immunoglobulins A are formed in large quantities.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But so far there is no decision on double vaccination," the doctor said.
The chief preventologist of the Ural Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injection vaccination is the ability to cease to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help by the fact that in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should be maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Huseynov, said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is exactly the picture observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to a dog (he died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm house, feeding, affection, love and games for a leaky, then go ahead.
But the pesel was trained and generally smart.
He chose my company and went home.
In the video, a method that works in 90% of cases.
Not taken from the ceiling, believe me.
I slowed down many owners so that they would not run after the dog, although they lamented that 200 thousand were running away (pomski), I took them by the hand and led them in the other direction.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog, which ran somewhere there.
In Europe, mass protests of opponents of vaccination do not stop
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the government's health policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards that read "This is a false pandemic" and "I won't get vaccinated."
A major protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of a number of regions of the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at police officers.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nicholas S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she began her studies earlier.
Let's just not argue, I believe they both deserve the title.
That's just one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans brought only death and plunder to any country, wherever they appeared.

WHO has already detected Omicron in six dozen states
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the new strain of coronavirus "Omicron" has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was told in the WHO message.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to actively spread only from the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may bypass the Delta strain, also known as the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is now leading in absolutely all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that Omicron will displace Delta in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million, despite the fact that officially several hundred people are currently sick with Omicron in the Kingdom, and according to estimates, up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, and at the peak, more than 2 thousand people will be taken to hospitals daily.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian Sputnik V reacts to omicron - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the omicron strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?

Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is completely different, they communicate easily and naturally, and in person there is nothing to say.

And again, the Soviet era is called the "time of demons."
Yes, then people believed in God much more honestly than today.
And they were brought up practically according to God's laws (love for one's neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What is the ideology today - money at any cost.
For talkers like Globa, faith is not enough (yes, it does not exist at all), but even if so, the time of demons came in the 90s ...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad communal apartment with Bolshaya Zelenina still maintains communication.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to preserve the warmth of relations between the older generation.
Maybe this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented, and the blockade brotherhood was not canceled.
Unfortunately, we see each other more and more often at funerals.

Russians warned about a new scheme of scammers
Attackers began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
Write about it \Izvestia \ with reference to experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, Director of Product at Ivideon, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication is deepfakes.
In this case, fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the behavior of a person.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, attackers can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video with a copy of a person to be sent for blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a savvy attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios," the expert said.
Alexander Vetkol, Lead Systems Engineer at Varonis, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this can create specific risks when it comes to technologies using video.

Listed are five actions that will help avoid diabetes
Blood sugar problems are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes mellitus can eventually lead to severe complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sugary foods raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by malnutrition, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise adhering to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about the "weekend migraine" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in well-being on the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often a "weekend migraine," said Zukhra Pavlova, a well-known endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Systemic Medicine Clinic, in her telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics are especially often affected by this, who have a headache, weakness and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to changing conditions.
On weekends, our lives change radically.
"We sleep for a long time, we lie on the couch all day, most likely we eat more and drink less," the doctor argued. - Due to a lack of coffee, a slight withdrawal begins.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and weakness.
An additional role is played by a late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, then there will be a reaction called jet lag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended to track what changes the most on the weekend.

South African scientists say Pfizer vaccine against Omicron is low
South Africa announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against Omicron
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (Omicron neutralization rate) corresponds to the (level) of vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which is why... the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection is being questioned, according to the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in familiar foods?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type II diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that an unfamiliar word in the composition of the product may indicate hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie content, composition and glycemic index.
Several dozen names can be presented on the label, in fact, denoting sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter what the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues the transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of transporting gas to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, within the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline so far "does not meet the requirements" of the European Union.

The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized bitcoin as legal tender, and that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.

In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results, announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third ballot was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favor of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, more than 80 thousand residents of New Caledonia took part in the elections.
As Agence France-Presse comments on these interim results, "the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt," as supporters of independence urged voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full-fledged and "honest" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for a third victory for supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
According to the separatists, they will not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, in the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron should speak on the results of this referendum.
The topic of New Caledonia's independence in many ways revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates spoke in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific."
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour said repeatedly.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate ValÃ©rie PÃ©cresse, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France".
Sveta, oh, hello!
I'll give you a little ... I was a little rude, still embarrassing, ashamed.
Thank you for not turning your back on my channel.

WSJ readers criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger posed by Moscow, and made a number of offensive statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "present a united front against Russia."
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quoted one of the readers as saying.
"Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never enter into a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine," said another.
Patches can also be applied to the lip area.
The hydrogel used in the production of Dearboo Peach & Hibiscus Brightening Hydrogel Eye Patch patches is a high-tech polymer that provides increased absorption and transfer to the skin of a highly concentrated natural plant essence, fits snugly to the skin and gives a feeling of freshness.
When transferring nutrients to the skin, the hydrogel minimizes the concomitant moisture loss and causes the essence to penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The center lies at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing a new generation of jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
This was announced on December 11 by a freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president, Oleksiy Arestovych.
That is, they are able to act against air targets, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and the like," Dialog.ua quoted him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovych said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it "in all respects."
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the joint forces in the Donbass.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kyiv region, which will conduct personnel training, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum "a big real step forward."
At the airport, two lions escaped from the container
Lions escaped at Singapore's Changi airport.
It is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were going.
One of the fugitive lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from it because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which is in charge of all Singaporean zoos.
They immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion escaped from the owner and walked through the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warned of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Studies show that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure up or down.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 tablets without a doctor's advice, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid cereal with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is, among other things, found in avocado, Fine recommended that men after 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, about 75 thousand people may die by April due to the omicron strain
Forecasts by British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of coronavirus, up to 75 thousand people may die in England in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergency Situations under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain will be recorded in the country, and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized in total.
At the same time, at the peak of the incidence, hospitals will receive more than 2 thousand infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be required to prevent the National Health Service from being overwhelmed if the omicron variant turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant and current vaccines cannot eliminate infections," said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Security Agency informed that if the rate of spread of the omicron strain continues at the current level, then by the end of the year about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
At the same time, by mid-December, the omicron strain may become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 have been detected over the past day.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10 thousand cases.
After all, I wanted to write some clever comment, but I read this far:
"A fur coat obtained as a result of the incredible suffering of the unfortunate animal and his employment for a second job."

It turns out that the "unfortunate animal" is a husband, and I thought it was a chinchilla!

The demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter in the world
The construction of superyachts this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and fight climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of yachts ordered was 1200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of combating the effects of climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for $ 50 million and above will not decrease, writes the Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such a stir in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted via zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more, as long as their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation, traveling into space, living on yachts or flying on their own planes cause irritation in society, since the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling governments to action and proposing new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, even though they understand that with such a mobility of money, this will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of superyachts ordered is impressive, but also their performance.
Of the 1200 vessels, 27 have stern lengths above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Recke is building the yacht REV Ocean with a length of 183 meters.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "lunar pool", as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, helicopter platforms, open-air cinemas have become commonplace, and on some of them, such as on the yacht of wrestler McGregor, a platform for martial arts.Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at the American University in Indiana, says that compared to the total number of greenhouse gas samples, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is negligible.
But it has a symbolic meaning, given that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission trail of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the footprint of the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the largest polluter on the planet, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission footprint fell on his yacht Eclipse with a length of 162.5 meters.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don't elicit other people's sympathy when they, like Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no room for a berth for their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships more than 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified, leading to the development of bowel cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts came to the conclusion that the use of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
What's more, moderate drinkers have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact reason for the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a process that is detrimental to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all dog lovers, are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to know for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study proves that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the publication Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, do not know anything about politics, economics and art, meanwhile they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show better results in understanding the words of the human language, but there is still not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have come to the conclusion that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, the United States and Russia are preparing for bargaining
The United States and Russia will "bargain" over Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for Glavred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "join anywhere."
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send an offerer.
And in relation to Ukraine, bargaining is planned," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks a dialogue with Kiev.
"The training is carried out covertly, quickly and immediately proceed to offensive operations, and do not wait for the group to be discovered and deployed by countermeasures," he said.
China stimulates the development of the railway transport industry
China's advanced technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transportation and Equipment Manufacturing Expo held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province (Central China).
The core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically identify and diagnose technical faults, said company spokesman Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will provide increased reliability and operability of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased exports of rail vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first double-decker high-speed electric trains developed in China for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, trial operation of the metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
Traffic on this metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxian, head of the trade and investment department of the China International Trade Promotion Commission (CCSMT).
"This industry accounts for the main competitive advantage of China's high-end equipment manufacturing in the global market," Feng Yaoxian said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced railway equipment manufacturing system, with a full range of auxiliary facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxiang, the country ranks first in terms of the level of electrification of railways and in terms of operating mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
The biologist listed the early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin in an interview with Radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of mild cognitive impairments, such as the inability to concentrate, plan, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
There is currently debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebral atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention on time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still being debated in the scientific community," Golosheikin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking," Golosheikin said.
Earlier, the dementia research charity in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-nervous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the council of doctors created under the Georgian ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is central to his disease.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president must be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which is not available in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging his medical care after he was disciplined by prison officials.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests were held against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife venues.
Many demonstrators came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected, over 88 thousand patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to introduce restrictions for the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a previous illness, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel by train and plane.

Steep climb: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will raise the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, landscaping work is also being carried out: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where the resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting vacation in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still a long way off.
Games management adviser Justin Downes says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year in winter, more and more Chinese go to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to create a ski culture here, Downes said.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and the infrastructure necessary for recreation has yet to be created there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, near the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chunli, now none of the locals suffer without work.
More and more shops selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
On the slopes, catering outlets with dishes of national cuisine are opened.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwa.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed down human progress towards universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
On the occasion of the International Day for Universal Health Coverage on 12 December, WHO and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of pocket".
In October, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, more than four billion people have practically no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister cut off from broadcast at Summit
Taiwan's digital minister, Audrey Tan, spoke at a panel discussion during the U.S.-sponsored Summit for Democracy was switched to video-free mode, according to a YouTube recording of the summit.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island to be its territory.
The map that Ms. Tan showed was compiled by the South African NGO CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world according to the degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as "free", and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were highlighted in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the panelists "do not necessarily express the position of the US government."
The PRC was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map shown by the Taiwanese minister could run counter to the "one China" policy that Washington adheres to.
One of the agency's sources said that after the demonstration of the map, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Summit for Democracy" was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge."
You are served information as if they are preparing food, and there is rotten meat everywhere, in fact, the meat remains with the butcher to the last bite.

The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China has issued a circular instructing to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land crossing points are located, in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving said cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those who come to cities where land crossing points are located must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in force from the day when the relevant provincial-level administrative units define and publish the zones of the said cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities in which land checkpoints are located and which meet certain conditions may consider the possibility of creating buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Foreign Ministry spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion based on the results of the long journey that we have traveled with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is related to the desire of the United States to impose approaches to Russia on a variety of issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not dare to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress has been observed.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of dangers of COVID nasal vaccine outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may be allergic and need medical help, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported to TASS by virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccine vaccination points at airports and shopping centers, but I would do it at first only in medical institutions.
The fact is that there is a probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that the person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that act literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in using the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using the nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person vaccinated with nasal congestion blows his nose after injection.

Alexander M., Please remind me what style the marathon was held at the 2021 World Cup?
Do you see the track on which the participants of the race should finish in the classic style?
Attention, the question is - what is Klebo doing to the right of Bolshunov and how does he want to get to the track if he was coming from behind on the turn in front of the target?
And the "best finisher" at 1.5 km and after 50 km are two different things.
It was a long time ago ...
I was, and in fact I was not a driver either.
They had rights, but they didn't know how to drive.
They offered to go 250 km in one direction at MAZ!
Young, bad, agreed.
The owner is nearby, drinking vodka, I'm going.
First, like a king, he took the axial!
A column lined up behind me.
Missed.
Then the belt on the power steering broke.
Then the traffic cops stopped us.
There was an organized convoy, and their car broke down.
Needs to be towed.
The owner of the MAZ explained that he was drunk, the driver was inexperienced.
And to him - how drunk are you?
You don't stumble, you don't fall.
Ahead of us with flashing lights and go!

During the day in the UK, 1239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of coronavirus were detected.
This is reported by Sky News.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the Omicron strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of cases of COVID-19 from the new strain in the UK has reached 3137 people.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in a pessimistic forecast, calculated that 75 thousand people could die in England by April due to an outbreak of coronavirus caused by the Omicron strain.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including because of the alleged "invasion" of the country.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions against Russia and not experience suffering yourself," the Kremlin spokesman said on the air of the Russia 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world."
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, German Gref, is sure that this is impossible.

The inhabitants of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to secede from France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French TV channel BFM. TV.
96.5% of voters voted against independence.
3,51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of ballots were canceled.
The level of participation in voting on this day was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the people of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
The majority of residents supported the presence of the archipelago as part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago, the territory is endowed with a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice with a difference of two years.

WHO tentatively considers Omicron to be less dangerous than Delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that Omicron is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in case of a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, Omicron has been registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic protein profile of the Omicron strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("the severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than with the "delta"," the WHO said in a technical statement.
The organization notes that so far all reported cases of Omicron infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the delta.
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, said that so far there is no reliable evidence that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Zelensky were named
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadym Denysenko listed four options for the development of events for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may be left without the support of the West, and also, possibly, will make compromises on the Donbass.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko said in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called a "perfect storm," assumes that Ukraine will cease to be supported by key Western countries, having reached an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such a development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kyiv may face in 2023.
"At the same time, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and confrontation between the authorities and key FIGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.) ", - added the ex-parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all."
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine can make compromises on the Donbass, as a result of which a confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former people's deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third variant of the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between the groups of the population who disagree with Zelensky and the president, which is why it is likely to seize control of the power bloc and implement "populist initiatives".
In the course of this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin to "reformat power," Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
This can lead to some event that will be a strong shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any likelihood of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, a survey by the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for ex-president Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, among all respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

On TV, I once saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries, and there watermelons were rolled up the ladder on board the ship like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrous in size.
I myself worked many times in my youth on the harvesting and loading of watermelons in the Astrakhan region and did not meet watermelons weighing more than a pound.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from melons and not earlier than the beginning of August.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "For a quote from Yevtushenko, they give 10 days, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
An HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑÐ²ÑÐ¾ÑÑÐ¸Ð¸Ð±Ð¾Ð»ÑÑÐµÑÐµÐ¼Ð¿Ð¾ÑÑ was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander under an administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public rally.
He was first detained on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, to the decline of common culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How did the police officers treat you during your arrest this time and earlier?
What did the department ask, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the officers were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, no matter how ridiculous it may sound in some context of this word.
On Pushkinskaya, riot police took it and took it harshly.
They asked in a standard way, about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
With the exception of the monkey blown on all 4 sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was doing.
And if, after the action, at least a few people begin to write their poems under this hashtag, I will not serve these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak privately at least in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of others, so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing else, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks excellent Russian and nevertheless resorts to the help of an interpreter.
And at official events, a transcript is kept in the old-fashioned way with a fountain pen, and the stenographer does not have to know several languages.

Researchers told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body's systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to its high fiber content, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use it can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root vegetable is best stewed or boiled, rather than fried in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate foods that are quickly broken down into sugars such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in personal subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the issuance of "Yandex"
Candidates for departure
In 2015, copyright holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Runet, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Ghazaryan, general director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to the regular change of domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Squid Game" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (part of AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the animated novelty "Encanto", but, judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univer. 10 years later" of the TNT channel (part of Gazprom-Media).

Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two surfaces of different softness - high rigidity and slightly more than average.
The composition of the product includes only high-quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs "micropackage".
This means that there are 2000 spirals per berth, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that gives a unique point adjustment.
"Micropackage" is the highest frequency of the whole variety of spring blocks "Dimax", therefore it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: at the top and bottom of the springs there are combinations of layers of coir and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has long had the status of a classic, since it conveys to the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If coir provides proper support for the back, then latex adapts the surface to the human body.
Case: the model comes in a quilted knitted Aloe Vera case.
At the request of the client, it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the bed is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: the warranty period is 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam that is used in the mattress is certified by CertiPUR.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Current Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the habitability of the clouds of Venus, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists have proposed instruments for measuring the acidity and oxygen content of the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Suppose that if we find life there, then the main question will be whether it is similar to the earthly or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mihkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of metaverses became popular this fall, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money go digital.
Anya, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fatty and harmful.

You can eat a spoonful, try - and that's enough.
After all, there are really ten days off ahead, you can cook any tasty and healthy dishes.

The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will turn out to be a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The coronavirus pandemic remains the most important factor, and inflation is in second place, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in commodity prices was temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of endless generosity of central banks has already outlived its usefulness" and it is time to return to a relationship where inflation-adjusted interest rates will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policy could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as rising poverty and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the global research department at Otkritie Investments, said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin called the Fed's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
At the end of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI).
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020.
In terms of revenue in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia is in the lead.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The related Kia brand Hyundai has an even greater increase - more than 35%, and revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand is also in the leading position in terms of increasing the weighted average price of the car - for the year it grew by almost 21% for Hyundai, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had stronger price increases.
At the same time, sales volumes from Korean brands did not grow so significantly: according to statistics from the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - by almost 12%.
Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand for 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+ 75%) - the German premium brand increased both sales (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"At the same time, Mercedes-Benz has a good increase in sales and weighted average prices - more, for example, than BMW - hence the greater increase in financial capacity," explained Tatyana Arabadzhi, general director of NAPI. -
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are showing fantastic performance, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
Russian Lada in terms of revenue growth dynamics shows average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
At the level of last year, in terms of financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales in units fell in 2021: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is completely in the red - for 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and interruptions in production that have swept the entire global automotive industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same AvtoVAZ increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last rise in price (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Other automakers regularly rewrite the price tags for their products.
The volume of the Russian automobile market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation contributes to this, as well as the desire of automakers to win back past losses, experts say.
In the context of a shortage of cars, I think that many automakers were even able to partially shift to the consumer the costs of past periods, which they could not include in the price of cars earlier,
says Vladimir Bespalov, an analyst at VTB Capital for the automotive industry. -
I believe that financially, automakers are doing very well right now, maintaining high sales margins.
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, prices for new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complication of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the increase in supply, the opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income at the expense of volumes, said independent consultant on the automotive industry Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automakers are striving to get the greatest profit from each car sold, Burgazliev notes. -
An increase in the production of cars is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also fueled by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current market situation, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold at a higher price than the original cost, the expert states.
Biden spoke about the transfer of the US military to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending the US military to Ukraine in the event of an "invasion" by Russia.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
"There have never been such plans," the head of the White House said, answering a journalist's question about whether the United States abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, the B9 - all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kyiv, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory."
I immediately leave such interviews.
If already at the interview they want to force me to listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible burda and wash another cup, it's scary to imagine what will happen at work.

If a scammer calls from such a number, like an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another law enforcement agency, then it is ineffective to immediately dump, and most likely you will not have time to blacklist.
Because in order to confirm his lies about his involvement in law enforcement agencies, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to frighten and persuade.

As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey show, in my opinion, you, to put it mildly, are not in the subject.
