The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I am a #PRS_ORG# major customer so it is not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instructions about what I should include in the package so that you can track it as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for €249.
Today it costs €179.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder it for the better price or is there another way to get credit?
In principle, I also think that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it's also good for older siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, help a little, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way they learn responsibility, help out in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be children enough themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can best decide for yourself whether this is right for your children.
It's not like he's supposed to swaddle K2 and accompany him to sleep for hours.
From a purely legal perspective it is probably questionable.
Maybe that's where the psychologist's statement comes from.
Because if something were to actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can't remember the title, maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by pouring food on himself and going into the enclosure with his big cats.
The case is taken over by an inspector who, after a short investigation, comes across his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxious patients.
The inspector has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before each suicide to go to the place of suicide and document it and put the photos on the internet.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where a chip is transplanted into the patients that suppresses a fear center in the brain and the patients ultimately have to face their fear in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death)
This facing of fear is referred to in the book as “the fight”.
At the end there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's the rough plot. I'm pretty sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If anyone knows this plot or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh dear, I don't have the WiFi password available.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to have the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has splinters of wood under his thumbnail (outside) along the entire length.
Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chances.
Tomorrow we're going to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Thanks to the combination of digital decoder and sound module on one circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive with gauges H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm “sugar cube” speaker and a sound capsule kit.
Like all members of the family, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
It supports the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Setrix® and M4.
In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed levels are as standard as 2 and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders log on to a suitable digital control center fully automatically.
It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main track can be read out with suitable control centers.
There are auxiliary registers for control panels that can only program CVs from 1-255.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels with 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic registration to mfx®-compatible control panels.
The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes the Märklin® braking distances as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake modules or with direct voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC automatic shuttle train enables automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog direct and alternating current railways.

Because of Omicron: Johnson wants to push ahead with booster vaccinations
Politics and science in Great Britain are constantly concerned about new omicron cases.
All qualifying adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer by the New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make progress with corona booster vaccinations even faster than previously planned in view of the rapidly increasing omicron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
Previously the target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support so that the vaccination campaigns can also be accelerated in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Given the Omicron variant, we are facing an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
“Get a boost now!” said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 more omicron cases were recorded in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, that was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm in favor of everyone introducing themselves using pronouns
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation for an interview came via email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately the name is not "Peter", but rather a somewhat more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she comes from culturally it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me please?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's feet.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves using pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Apparently the chair had a defect that was not apparent when it was sold.
How else can such upholstery damage occur after 9 months?
Only tried on the #PRS_ORG#.
But this has been working for approx.
14 days no more.
That's why I always bought the last books via the website and then read them on #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I want you to please add 2 chairs to the order and charge me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I'm going to write something about domestic violence in some detail here.
I just have to write something off my chest.
For professional reasons, I (21) often come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence.
One issue that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims don't allow themselves to be helped or think we can't help them.
It's clear to me that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my job that affect me more than when I can't do anything about such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation with the perpetrator far out of sight and earshot, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of tearing the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even when I'm very close to tears, is that everyone is worth being able to live without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it never gets any easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
“Arcane” on Netflix: How good is the series for “League of Legends”?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least youngster Johannes Patrick was reliable.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick said, looking back at the cup defeat at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
But that didn't subside after the game - but increased again given the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
What was more disappointing than the bare result was the manner of the performance.
A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma should be mentioned as a representative: The three-point rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in a whopping 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick provided the answer: "We simply weren't focused enough after the win in Tenerife and didn't implement what we had trained."
Namely, moving the ball.
His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted completely differently: “It was a great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time,” said the happy coach.
“It felt like it was in front of 10,000 people.”
Only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money's worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer TJ Shorts, who scored 22 points and directed his team's game.
“The best playmaker I have ever coached,” praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Giants avoid a total debacle and came within eight points after already trailing 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Luckily there isn't much time to argue.
The giants will welcome the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7 p.m.), in front of a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I contacted you a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We found out more about the legal situation and wrote to them again.
We originally contacted you six months ago.
Always looking good: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to delight his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
He is currently on the road with the program “Guten Tag, meine Glück” – if he is allowed to appear.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official instructions" in order to contain the corona virus.
Other of his performances planned for the Advent season also have to be canceled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to make up for the dates that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe enjoyed singing a lot as a teenager.
He studied opera singing in Berlin and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has received numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts - just like his successful album "For Women That's No Problem" (2013).
He made it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, his blonde hair strictly combed back and careful about etiquette, Max Raabe has become an integral part of the current German-speaking music landscape.
He has been on tour with the program “Guten Tag, meine Glück” since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be complemented with existing furniture and so we could check beforehand whether the color matches
It still doesn't work I can only see the cover page but can't scroll.
Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz: No new apartment will be created through expropriation
The new Federal Construction Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as was called for in a referendum in Berlin.
“With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes,” said Geywitz in an interview with the “Tagesspiegel” (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up a commission of experts on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out discussions with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of tenancy law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to get this implemented as quickly as possible.
If the rental market still doesn't improve, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I realized that I had forgotten the last step of the payment.
Unfortunately the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or whether it will even happen again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Voucher sounds great
Then I redeem it independently for the new order
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
I've already cut my finger
This is an absolute disgrace
At least 100 dead in tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system caused numerous tornadoes to rip through the United States.
There could be more than 100 deaths in Kentucky alone.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
On Saturday night, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms left a path of approximately 200 miles (320 kilometers) of destruction, particularly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everything was gone wherever the tornado had passed through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants and roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that the showcase #NAME# is sold out.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely discontinued?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
Until when will you report?
If delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I now order the blanket that is in the shopping cart and have it delivered to Germany?
I had returned an item or made a return using the contact form and wanted to ask whether it had arrived or was being processed, as I had not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for vaccination.
This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into calls for vaccinations - based on the German model - is also intended to increase willingness to receive corona vaccinations.
He moved to a company that he gossiped about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Just wait and see.
It's been a year.
He obviously wasn't stuck in his old place and was looking for something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I take a screenshot.

Help with your first campaign
Greetings to Boron!
I'm currently running the adventure Over the Greifen Pass for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big picture has been made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been thought out and now I'm in the process of writing the introductory adventure and am already stumbling over my own feet in the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a wagon full of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the further plot will develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins ambush the heroes and lure them into an ambush.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in a variety of ways: persuading, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early, whatever the players can think of.
Group size: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
If they don't notice, the goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a ravine and flank the cart, three on the left and right, armed with bows, while two with spears stop the cart.
If a fight breaks out and the heroes lose, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
Of course the cart is gone.
2. If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How appropriate do you think Deus ex Machina is to Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so they're not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas to heart and now I have more confidence in my narratives again.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put together again.
Sadly it still does not work.
That's why I would still like to send them back
Can you then send us the return receipts, then I can pack the lamp and take it to #PRS_ORG#.

I'm annoyed with Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a little with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was stopped today in the middle of the F2 race in order to allow the F1 preliminary reporting to begin on time.
Although the schedule was far behind schedule due to the delayed start and the accident at the start, the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) could still have been shown.
Apparently, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, especially since Sky UK finished broadcasting the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes covered the difficult situation surrounding the serious accident well.
Then in F1 there was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both of them didn't know that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although this situation had already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both of them only came to the decision that Verstappen could change the tires when there were radio messages to Hamilton on the subject.
Both commentators on Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that this opportunity existed for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that you should simply know such elementary rules if you comment on F1 for a pay-TV channel.
It's not the first guess as to what is possible or required according to the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties when it comes to rules.
In general, I don't like Roos' artificial commentary style, but I admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I seriously even like Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
There are also constant silliness that make both of them seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular causes a lot of unrest in the comment, which he obviously doesn't take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising is simply getting out of hand on Sky, in the final round Sky is the only station that does advertising, as you can listen to on F1TV because only the German soundtrack has to do without commentary directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels also advertise less during training than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although Glock and Baumgartner have to be praised for their work, that alone doesn't allow me to ignore the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language channel that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL is doing a better job with the four races that they are still allowed to broadcast, apart from the advertising.
In any case, the fantastic F1 season is a lot less fun than it would be with a sensible broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On this one: #PRS_ORG# pendant light, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an item that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me it would be sent out on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday she would review and send an email and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12, 2019.
One of them developed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I ask for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying an aquarium with additional oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using air jacks.
We offer this series in 3 variants.
Take a look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect several air stones.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model, the fan pump can also be used to set an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (you can find it in our shop) or with a decoration that shows the air bubbles convert into a function.
A treasure chest, shell or something similar could be mentioned here.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an air vent or similar using a 4/6 mm air hose... and you're ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and installed outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, you should put a check valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent water from running backwards from the pool through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, like other air pumps, it should be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that consume little energy
Even though we state the processing time here on eBay as 3 days, packing takes place daily and the packages are also picked up here every day.
If everything goes well along the way, it happens very quickly.
We just want to take a little precaution so that no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be like this, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry... of course Corona doesn't stop here.
Please do not give a bad rating just because the delivery is delayed, that is entirely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment...they're having a damn hard time
This also varies greatly regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times.
how long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in light color?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company.
The approximately ten-minute flight took off and landed in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a clear blue sky, Bezos himself welcomed the newly crowned astronauts upon their return.
“Welcome back,” said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To applause from friends, family and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who flew into space as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were guests of honor at the company , the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not say how much they each paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard during his missions and do everything himself.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would like to go back into space straight away, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to an altitude of 100 kilometers
The New Shepard missile system flies largely automatically.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily in weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again, slowed down by large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above Earth to be the limit to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned space flight: Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board on the first in July, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second one in October included 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy boss by Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing forward the space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without taking the climate into account.
At the push of a button, you can easily choose whether your »Smart Stone« should glow permanently in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
When set to color change, the luminous stone maintains one light color for around a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the “Smart Stone” lamp proves itself outdoors all year round.
Their light works particularly well in snowy environments - only a shortened lighting duration is to be expected as soon as the days become shorter.
In winter, please just make sure that no snow affects the function of the solar module.
»Smart Stone« uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon (“AA”) format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I'm currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and standing in the laboratory doesn't bother me either (I've already completed the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I also found out about career prospects before I started studying, but at the time I also thought that I definitely wanted to and would continue to study until I got my doctorate.
At the moment I'm having doubts, and I'm particularly depressing about the career prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck, etc.) you always hear about great career opportunities and that the profession is really sought after, but on the other hand you keep hearing about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
So I would really be interested in:
1) What are you currently working as?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What did you study/what training did you do?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really unsure at the moment and am thinking about possibly stopping my studies in 2022 and training to become an IT specialist.
If you have experience with this, please write about it :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up for me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why a post about it now.
It's not just before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, that there's a lot of stress in our company.
It seems like it's also available before public holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption Day, which we in Switzerland call “the Ascension”.
On Friday, most people and companies have a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week we had a long 4-day weekend coming up.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of emails that absolutely had to be sent out before the drive up, an order here, an order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... yes, because?
Because “next week” sounds like so much time and that shouldn’t be the case?
Or because people seriously want to accomplish as much in a shortened week as in a normal week?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also extremely annoyed.
What's this self-hostagement about the holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we can't really treat ourselves to them?!
Mind you, the stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all on their own.
My question is simple: Is it just us, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed evangelical way?
Or do you also know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but doesn't have any presents yet.
“The nice thing is that even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest,” said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get in the mood for the festival by baking cookies and making crafts with her son.
“I love this,” Catterfeld said.
But she still has a lot to do before the contemplative days: "For the first time I don't have any presents yet, I finally have to get started."
NEKTON-Bio supports the smooth process of moulting and the formation of new plumage.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird smooth and shiny feathers.
The majority of plumage damage that occurs in bird keeping can only be attributed to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substances, the bird must have a particularly rich and balanced protein diet in order to form perfect feathers.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large proportion of animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account and balances the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed.
No other vitamin preparations should be administered while using NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately it still doesn't work
GDR handcrafted model of an old electric locomotive E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion suggestion of the model railroader ME issue 11/1968, used with signs of use and missing parts, see photos, function well, The E 95 series is a heavy freight electric locomotive from the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network. The kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and has been refurbished to make it operational
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at a cruising speed of 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed required was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided to deliver the locomotive as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with a bearing drive. AEG would deliver the mechanical part and Siemens-Schuckertwerke would deliver the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which were given the company numbers E 95 01-06.
All of them survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of what later became the GDR.
In 1946 the locomotives were sent to the Soviet Union as reparations.
They returned to Germany by November 1952.
The Dessau Reichsbahn repair shop determined that all six locomotives were worth refurbishing.
[4] As the increasing re-electrification of the Central German network resulted in an increasing need for locomotives for heavy freight train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished in 1959, with the remaining machines serving as spare parts donors.
The E 04, E 44 and E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were initially preferred.
Only when it became apparent that the E 94 could not be further increased in terms of reconditioning did the E 95 become the focus of reconditioning.
[4]Initially the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They came to the Halle P railway depot in 1960.
They were used in their own circulation plan, mostly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal towards Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of the locomotives became problematic as they got older.
It often happened that contactors got stuck during switching operations.
Then the passenger, who was constantly traveling on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and wooden wedge to loosen the gates while the locomotive was moving.
Damage to the traction motors occurred frequently and led to locomotive failures lasting months.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives available at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electrical operations was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to do without old locomotives and most of the splinter classes, so that the E 95 were taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to man electric locomotives with one man, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the difficulties mentioned with the machines and the visibility from the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were shut down in mid-1969, the last to follow them was the E 95 01, which left service on October 5, 1970.
The planned new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system at Halle main station.
It still took some time before those responsible at the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the external refurbishment of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show at the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
The internal completion of the locomotive took place in 1986.
The locomotive is cared for as a museum in the DB Museum Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the traditional Bw Halle P community have been working on making the locomotive operational.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new internal and external paintwork, the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were in use on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branch lines until 1945, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and low maintenance requirements.
In February 1945 the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
The main area of operation was initially Silesia
Hand-made model H0 in original packaging, works well, the locomotive needs to be reworked in-house, dusty, with signs of play, cellar smell!!!, very rare hand-made model, very small edition - the kit may also come from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, they are the F parts
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet...unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't put the bed together.
The middle beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately manufactured incorrectly.
The center bar does not fit into the holder provided.
So I get new ones sent to me.
When will they be sent out?
no, no flat ones.
According to the assembly instructions, these are the correct shapes, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they serve their purpose
For me they are not flat
Could I have these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential house fire with two slightly injured people and extensive damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, estimated damage in the six-figure euro range was caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire probably spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to hospital on Sunday with minor smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not assume that the fire was intentionally set.
The Fürstenfeldbruck police have taken over the further investigation.
But it arrives much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
Biontech boss Uğur Şahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur has now published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
Şahin said that a friend's illness prompted him to do this.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I was supposedly not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote in a post on the LinkedIn network on Friday.
“For several months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter these false rumors.”
So far he has rejected this because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine was currently fighting for his life.
He is battling severe Covid-19 disease and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin wrote.
He didn't ask why.
“However, the most common cause appears to be fear, often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.”
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, so sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the Internet in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was made in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
“I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself,” Şahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany when it comes to vaccination.
The prioritization has now been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech boss says he has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in the substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
The lights went out in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases no heating either.
A fire had shut down a substation.
After a fire with serious damage to a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to survive without electricity for around 24 hours.
The fire caused the lights to go out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the large-scale disruption was finally completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for help from neighbors.
The provider thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would also like to thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the primary technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
Repairing the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz fitters were initially only able to temporarily put some lines back into operation, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday around 7:15 p.m. severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
A further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9.30 p.m.
Those most recently affected by the outage have also had power since 11:15 p.m.
Over 80 fitters from Westnetz and partner companies were on duty.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for help from neighbors.
“It is now important that citizens take care of older or single people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire department if help is needed,” explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was primarily on residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not look after themselves or who needed electricity-dependent medical equipment or were dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the bedspread #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount the base frame on the table top.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table top diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
My #PRS_ORG# arrived today, but I can't put them together and therefore shorten them.
Can you help me there?
Otherwise I would have to send it back because it would otherwise not be suitable for its purpose.
I would be happy to receive feedback
yes, that is really easier!
Then we do it like that!
Can you send me the return slip by email?
the repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG# before purchasing.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We don't agree with that
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to admit defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the cross-country ski run with a big lead after ski jumping.
Returning the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have rebuilt both s and are using version 4.5...
It could be that you have often heard about problems
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it too.
As soon as I want to open it, the message pops up, oops!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrect, contact customer service.
As far as I can tell it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone, now what?
I also have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the components of dust, grease and fingerprints with a little soapy water, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you apply the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is advisable to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will no longer be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Drag the brush evenly line to line.
Slightly overlapping the layers of paint later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quickly wiping back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
Otherwise the dark ones could show through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors are added at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unsightly metal streaks can occur if they mix with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before installing them.
The models achieve their original appearance thanks to the decals.
From national emblems on aircraft to ship names to trim and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order while the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Time, patience and a steady hand are even more important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them.
Decals are also called water slide decals because you briefly moisten the back with water until the backing paper becomes dark due to the moisture.
Then you push the picture just a small piece off the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away to the side.
Attention: Always check whether the picture is sitting correctly before you slide it completely off the paper so that it doesn't stick to your finger, crease or even tear.
Vacuum up excess water with a household towel.
Warning, not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look for something else then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and load the book again and look for the place where I have read.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Will I receive this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp arrived in 3 individual packages
OK, thank you very much anyway!
Then I will buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But can I get it back without any problem?
Fertility treatment with private health insurance / What is an “insured event”?
Hello everyone,
We were undergoing fertility treatment for some time, but now when it comes to billing with the private health insurance, it suddenly becomes a problem.
Sequentially:
We had applied for fertility treatment from the PKV in advance and were approved for three attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child and made two (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet bill these to the PKV.
We applied again for the PKV to cover the costs and were granted three more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we carried out more experiments than promised, so we logically bill the PKV for the most expensive ones) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants 3 Reimburse attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts at the first confirmation expire.
The second wish to have children is a new insurance claim.
However, according to the General Terms and Conditions, “The insured event begins with the medical treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists.”
The questions for the experts in the group here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (5 attempts are to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have informed us in the promises that further attempts would expire after a birth?
* Is the desire to have a second child really a new insurance event?
Infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how best to reach them again
In order.
We will not be ordering anything from them again.
If you add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), you obviously lost good customers.
Please feel free to forward this to your manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund had been arranged and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first.
It's probably not my fault that the chest of drawers arrives at me completely distraught
Please see what the colleague wrote in the screenshot
It clearly states that the refund has been initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect only appeared after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise you won't be allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cupboard and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series from #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional stools that can be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find these for you.
Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low budget films
There is no general definition with exact budget limits as to what exactly a low-budget film is.
Wikipedia has this to say about it:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives in this category?
What attracts you to it?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours and have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to find out the best price for the Odelle gray leather sofa.
The delivery time has now been extended again. Is it reliable now?
Vielen Dank
Best regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately nothing changes in the waiting position... I soon give up again because it just doesn't work here.
Hallo
“Half victory” against Belarus entails high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation in the long term, explained the researcher at the Berlin Science and Politics Foundation (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not giving in completely, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently there is an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not take decisive action against this, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development also weakens cohesion in the Union.
“It obviously cannot prevail if a member state decides to do its own thing,” like Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, said Bossong: A fundamental agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to Poland's border guards, migrants have again tried to reach Polish territory via Belarus.
A spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday that 55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border.
The Polish officers were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident not far from the town of Czeremsza.
According to reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to receive medical attention from a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
A group of 28 migrants had already overcome the border barriers on Friday evening.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania sealed off sections of their border.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners traveled to people's countries of origin to prevent people from leaving there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on airlines, said Bossong.
“The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough measures and extraterritorial sanctions.”
Minsk must also take domestic political costs into account.
Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen is said to have broken two rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged an objection.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
One protest relates to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second appeal was made against the rating at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' opinion, the protocol was not followed according to the rules.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I will check this.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you
thanks for the support
Free entry for members: Europa-Park organizes SC Freiburg Fan Day
Europa-Park, namesake for the Sport-Club Freiburg's Europa-Park stadium, has invited people to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park reports, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit Europa-Park for free on that day.
There were also vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains glowed red and white through the jerseys that day.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and lots of red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fan Day in Europa-Park it was once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing beaming fans having fun together on the roller coaster confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is it €#NUMBER# and not the original €1699?

Judith Hermann read from her novel “Daheim”
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" in the sold-out Blue Note on Friday and also acted as a presenter.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nightly sounds at her front door.
Yesterday I submitted the contact form to return an item, but did not receive an email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be whether my request was received.
Not everyone has the time for your stupid chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all from our household.
Contact Ms. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Ms. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a new order for the #PRS_ORG# bedside table and a return label.
This email has not come yet.
The package would like to be delivered to #PRS_ORG# today.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything.
It's like an afdler saying he has nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit their i’s.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself then you should just leave it completely.
Yes wow then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution in principle is simply completely lost.
As far as I'm concerned, a god started this whole thing.
But once you're a creationist you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science is just spouting nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatic-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass right up to the edge zone with virtually no distortion or color errors.
Magnifying glasses are often marked with magnification information.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to get the most out of your magnifying glass, we ask you to follow the instructions in the "Technical data" table (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including magnifying glasses.
An anti-reflective coating significantly reduces these reflections.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).

Fir sales in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many a strange situation when selling fir trees.
Once a man is said to have even driven home without his partner because they couldn't come to an agreement.
Every year he plants around 2,000 of them.
The 56-year-old has already experienced many a strange situation.
That always makes the run-up to Christmas a little fun, he says.
And that with the voucher??
Otherwise I'll be gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to argue about which dish is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And that's where both get their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I'm now having problems setting up a stable WiFi network.
I previously had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which, apart from a few failures, received and sent out 50 Mbit without any problems.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and these also arrive at the DLan module that is connected to the FritzBox.
However, the full 500 no longer arrives at the other DLan module, which sends out the WiFi, but the further away I move in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc .Rooms away from the other module).
This means that the internet with the new fiber optic connection on the first floor is now even slower than before (~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similarly large losses here too.
Could someone explain to me why with fiber optic so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, which is why I created a special account here.
That's why I would be even more happy about an answer.
When it's time to change your checking account
Anyone who would have thought that there would be peace and quiet with current accounts would be wrong.
While many banks used the autumn to use all sorts of tricks to get their customers to confirm past fee increases, the allowances for negative interest rates are also continuing to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the allowance and even quartered it for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for current account accounts.
However, these lower allowances now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request.
And not just for new contracts, but also for “newly made individual agreements with existing customers”.
Commerzbank had already lowered the limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
After all: According to figures from the Internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have an allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer advice centers, which even won against this regulation in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court.
The banks are now discussing whether the institutions should set up provisions in the event that the higher authorities also declare negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions have to be paid back to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But her life is like a roller coaster ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was voted the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine “The Hollywood Reporter”.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the “Friends” reunion and the continuation of her series “The Morning Show,” this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of her appearance.
After all, says Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, you read that right: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
It's actually a miracle that the hearts of female and male fans alike still fall to her.
Maybe because she's just unlucky with luck - and is still looking for true love.
And crossed the desire to have a baby off the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Let's hope that success and fame also make you happy.
An undignified end to a career: Raikkonen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
Das war's.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the barrier, Räikkönen had to park his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the “Iceman” ended his career in the premier motorsport class.
His wife Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He managed 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole 18 times and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich takes his 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the bobsleigh pilot's goal.
“I did the math, I would have to achieve nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026,” said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, on Saturday he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, moving from third to first.
Then he changed something about the material settings and achieved a larger lead of 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed ahead of the Brit Brad Hall.
The Austrian Benjamin Maier came third.
“We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded,” said Friedrich, who also achieved his 22nd win in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, driving for Stuttgart, came fifth this time after second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach ended up in eighth place after fourth place in the first race.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way too,” said Lochner.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
For the women, Laura Nolte took her third win of the season in the two-man bobsleigh on her home track.
After only finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced to World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple success with pusher Deborah Levi.
Two-man Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualification, she recorded her first podium finish this winter.
Kim Kalicki from Wiesbaden came in third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was super cool, first podium finish in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I'm super happy with the development.
There's still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there's also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely error-free driving, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Because of Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for them.
And now they said it had expired, which really upset me.
Take a look at the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again because it is currently reduced :)
Why is shipping only on March 16th? started?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message
Was picked up by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new, undamaged one
And don't cancel the entire order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello dear great girls and women,
I have a few things that I just want to write and maybe some people will feel the same way...
I'm 24, have PTSD, a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's actually my child 1 to 1.
My boyfriend (we've been together for 6 years) is sick, got a second degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him. We cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn).
On top of that, he has a cold and we are currently seeing each other less (1-2 times a week), which is causing me a lot of problems with my needs for affection and love.
My little dog just has a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cozy blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there for him with the heat lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is currently away for a month.
Now we also have to do housework, which we of course divide up.
But cooking myself is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD is currently quite well controlled, I'm treated reasonably well and I'm coping.
Not good, but I'm coping and almost symptom free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me) at the moment, tomorrow at 3 p.m. I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow an anatomy lesson for which I should prepare at least a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space.
So my week goes like this: Only until the day after tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then the whole thing continues?
Just until your birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed right now that I need these mental clues, otherwise I won't be able to do it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same?
Honestly, I'm incredibly grateful that I don't have to work.
Really incredibly grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think that partly has something to do with the mental load on women and that's why I thought I'd definitely find fellow sufferers here...
I definitely wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today unfortunately the entire color is different plus the surface is scratched and the table leg has a mark.
When first delivered the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we swap the table now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on December 26th #NUMBER#.
Incidentally, twice.
But it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: Back at school I noticed that many religious teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography.
It was always a bit strange for me, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed that way.
What's your opinion?
Maybe you can also talk about work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between personal and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum etc.
But I would also find it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something?
Hope your question isn't too private.
Can't it be changed or not? I like to write in English and I understand that well too
It's been a long time, so I would refrain from doing it
It's fine, thanks.
I expect a response soon, at the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
There are two timelines (or parallel worlds) in the film.
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead)(not entirely sure).
Since I can't describe it in more detail anyway, in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and a plot emerges.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that she can live herself, I think.
I believe the crossing is also the soldier's gravesite.
In the end, I think both soldiers fight against each other.
If this means something to you, I would be grateful for any answer.
From week 1, our little one only slept on her stomach.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax yourself.
A child like that can endure a lot more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is correct, no cuddly toys, go in and look often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That's driving you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when he sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it stand up slightly from its stomach?
Or is it lying face first directly in the mattress?
From this you can determine whether everything is OK.
We all grew up and when my husband was born it was common practice for the kids to be put on their stomachs to sleep.
We are also already “regular customers” and have already purchased a lot of items
But then why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and haven't heard back yet.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cupboard.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard cannot currently be used.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be maintained.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's just that the politics of this station are now a mess.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but at the same time it goes on a big begging spree.
It was said that they were an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: You don't want to "be a running advertising column."
What are you now?
A run-of-the-mill advertising channel that tries to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Which of course apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How can you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I ask for a call back because the wooden table I delivered was defective.
Body broken due to damaged delivery of the #PRS_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for a stomach ache or just for cuddling – my little warming friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry stone pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry stones can absorb heat very well and release it again in doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cover makes it particularly pleasant to use, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they are not feeling so well.
The cherry stone pillow with cover is only suitable as a warming pad for the following areas of application:
Before heating the pillow, check for an unusual smell, mildew or burn marks and, if found, dispose of them immediately.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover beforehand to warm it up!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (observe the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
During the first few warm-ups, a slight moisture build-up may occur on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the heating instructions given, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and burns!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that heating grain products is permitted in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner pillow has been placed back into the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow to see if it is suitable for babies (max. 43 °C) on the crook of your arm!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruises and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced sensitivity to pain.
If you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels are emerging, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and out of the reach of children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be checked regularly during use to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents that have occurred in connection with the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt second after the first series - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the bottom of the table.
Things aren't going well for Ingolstadt under the third coach either.
Rejoicing in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and approx. 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone was enough to operate.
None, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply being plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Maybe you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in mains operation?
Is something else broken?
Many thanks for your help!
I would like the #PRS_ORG# to be delivered to my room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still have a lot of equipment with you?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20 liter capacity can easily accommodate larger photo equipment, which can be safely stowed away using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever other everyday items you need remain well organized and separable from your photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the “update” of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also has a new look.
The chic, minimalist design literally has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still allowing access to photo equipment in a matter of seconds.
This works in two ways: First, conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself on messenger bags.
There is a metal locking hook in the closure flap with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken different “filling levels” into account: there are 4 anchor bars, sturdily riveted, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar; if it is empty, take a lower one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
This means that the backpack can be closed reliably without snapping the hook into place.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional top access backpacks - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the suitability of the backpack for everyday use enormously: if you not only take your photo equipment with you, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more on this below) and easily store both separately - and access them independently through the two side openings.
This means you can also pull the backpack in front of your body from the right side, for example to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the contents stay dry even if you head to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately I'm waiting in vain for the email from your support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning of the
The shipping company announced that they would contact us to pick up the incorrectly delivered table.

I ask for immediate processing.
I am now writing to the third support employee, and none of them got me further than the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.

Is it possible to predict when the cupboard could be delivered again?

It works.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. when will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on January 12, 21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher for me, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And I had no idea that the past year would turn out differently than expected and I wasn't able to redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But as a customer I have the damage and I don't accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the demands of dynamic drivers who value reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from cast iron and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned windows are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics that are specific to certain windows and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which balances the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The tuned discs manufactured in this way ensure a high level of comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additional openings created increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the gates improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned windows underline the character of every car with their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man spotted glowing chunks in the water at the south fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and sparked the so-called “California Gold Rush” of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and most prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were staked out, tents pitched, and saloons and hotels sprung up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was “Coloma or Bust”!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your fellow pioneers to avoid going broke with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that “works” more and more for you (so-called “engine building”).
The buildings on your board allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual play style with subtle adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly and simultaneously select a location on the board to perform actions.
Then their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Players then take turns performing actions such as gaining resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops, and positioning gunslingers.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The advertiser rotates to a new location at the start of each round, changing the actions available.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
Once players have contributed enough gunslingers and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive reduced rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

“Why children are not tyrants” documentary, ARD media library
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary popped up on my Twitter timeline today and I watched it straight away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures across Europe.
With his book "Why our children become tyrants" (2008) he sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please take care, the film is difficult to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Us parents and other responsible people must never, never, never do this! about power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom to develop and to make the framework for the child as large as is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the abolition of the test requirement for those who have been vaccinated three times
At their next meeting, the health ministers of the federal states want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the test requirement for people who have been vaccinated three times.
“We countries need clarity quickly as to whether and from when the test requirement can no longer be required for those who have been vaccinated three times,” said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to “Bild am Sonntag”.
The elimination of 2G plus for people who have been vaccinated three times is “not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to vaccinate,” said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers next Tuesday." − afp
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I best proceed?
Hello, I think the #PRS_ORG# chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases using my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Oops, an error occurred.
Purchasing can be done via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
The most common is hearing noises/voices, less often seeing images and, most rarely, noticing pain.
Relevant to this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is removed.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment of mine describes awareness correctly, but** u/Nitemarex **by definition didn't have any.
I misread your comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately the €20 doesn't help us either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the area of eCommerce.
Please check again whether you at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I already sent you an email that you didn't answer.
The question again.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was informed that they only deliver to your doorstep - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor for me.
won't I get a call?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle dies at the age of 97
He has made a name for himself as a theater critic and as an artistic director.
He later wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
The new book is still on the table, hot off the press: “An old man gets older”.
The harrowing diarium of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I'm here to express my gratitude for life."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are used as load carriers, especially in Europe.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria each year is not recorded
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.

In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York prevailed against Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tipps & Tricks
A week ago I got a lot of great tips here for the perfect goulash.
I had this for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thanks again for that :)
Now I've got a taste for it and want to cook roulades for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I'll start a beef stock for it.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, just a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I can manage it
IIt's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already on January 18th. informed by email that the refund had been made.
But to date I have not received the money.
Would you please check there.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and the presents.
You haven't gotten any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll tell you where you can get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube power amplifier contributes significantly to the warmth and fat content of the guitar amp sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls you can adjust the desired level and the distortion level of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL control that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the gain and distortion.
It was already mentioned above that you can even use the POWER LEVEL control to create a power reserve when things get outrageously loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, the full potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a speaker simulation, so that you get an extremely “acoustic” sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX socket so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot switch, you can easily call up the sounds using your foot, switch the effect blocks on/off and "tap" the tempo of the compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen it that way with others.
Is there an option for you to send the lamp back?
Because it hangs too low to hang over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me further with this?
And the dresser?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work, I would also be happy with a discount or voucher.
Maybe I can find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need is a bit much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know whether screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the hook provided.
That's not a satisfactory answer and it wasn't worth the wait
Do you have premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal negotiations
According to Iranian sources, there are signs of progress in the negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told the Irna news agency on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development" because initially there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
Talks in Vienna to revitalize the agreement continued on Thursday after an interruption of almost a week.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - the Free State is now the state with the highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
The value is the only federal state above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia was the only federal state to have the corona incidence above the 1000 mark on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value as 1,025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has recently had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday the incidence in Thuringia fell slightly, but was also above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 people seriously ill with Covid-19 were treated in intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with recording new cases.
I understand that.
Since delivery won't take place until the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and hand it to the post office, that's it right?
I don't have to click/specify/fill out anything else here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I would like to pay for the return shipping at my own expense.
In my opinion, an 8 euro return fee is a disgrace.
It is time for changes
###MBundestag greetings, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why is this post here?
If you look at the activity of the Bundestag in the past few months, you can see one thing: it does not exist.
We have entered into a winter state and have extended the summer slump to a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was it about?
For the most part, this is probably simply due to dissatisfaction with how some things have turned out here and how we generally behave.
In the last few days there has been a growing impression that many people here are still keen on the Bundestag.
#What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and found, to put it simply, a shambles.
After some writing back and forth, several people from the community found themselves interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would once again like to expressly call on everyone to take part, so that this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas and work out specific things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How should the Bundestag function in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we appear to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot a few things, but that's not a bad thing, we have the Discord at the end.
If you have the time and desire, come to the Discord, work together and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/clunky and not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered another suspension from you for this.
I put it together and then noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the bedspread #PRS_ORG#, is it also available in oversize, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the faulty cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to do that now.
I don't have suitable packaging, but I will dismantle the cabinet as far as possible for collection - you have to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pickup appointment.
Are there instructions for assembly?
How long would I have to get these or decide to return them?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She herself was a vegetarian for a while and currently rarely eats meat.
I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before.
When asked whether I had always wanted to be vegan and whether vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without thinking too much.
Namely, for a long time I thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately also supporting animal cruelty.
Hence my decision to become vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that dissatisfaction arose on her part, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian you reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too “clunky”?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without you even making any effort.
Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
This is clearly not an exception according to Section 312d of the German Civil Code (BGB).
Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be there on the assigned date when #PRS_ORG# will pick up my return.
Unfortunately, since I can't be there because of a funeral, that can't be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pickup date.
From February 1st #NUMBER# I can be found again continuously.
Lahnstein weir equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented Mayor Peter Labonte with a grant of 45,000 euros for the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department's new water rescue equipment vehicle in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The equipment truck is used by the Lahnstein diving squadron, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and below water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, a permanent increase in operations is expected: the boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed her recommendations but synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole campaign has cost me a lot of time and I'm now hoping for help.
Okay, that's it then.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter an appointment during the ordering process?

First of all, thank you for taking on the whole matter here, I also spent almost a decade in the civil service in a similar position, i.e. we were also weapons carriers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into it any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be very simplified.
Basically, one should say that the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
It should also be clear to everyone that people on the right of conservative are magically attracted to people wearing uniforms and weapons, and that these people then of course have a hard time dealing with the reality they live in. It is of course also clear, because in addition to the average white person, you now have a lot of Germans with you Migrant backgrounds, women and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the overly feminine stereotypical gays, because there are fewer or none of them in the executive branch, just normal men and women who you can't tell if they don't tell you) and also on I can and must rely on these people, because if in doubt they will save your life or use it for you.
But in my experience, even if it sounds strange at first, these fringe groups also have a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less supported by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if these politics supposedly support them or mean it right for them they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since of course the police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but the fact that they are allowed to openly express their opinions or even openly make any plans that are dangerous to the state is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed abroad often start to generalize because of negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or even politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing comrades meet and engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, something like this is being fought well and the whole thing is being counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so intertwined internationally and that's a good thing in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German site.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered it wasn't sold out.
I already ordered in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket in black to Germany for #NUMBER# euros or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I always only find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wooden part there are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow
and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself
Neater by child?
Hello, something has been bothering me (w32) for a long time.
I'm very disciplined and organized at work (I'm self-employed and have very little free time), but throughout my life I've struggled to keep my household clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything is left lying there, and now and then I get a hold of it and tidy up and clean.
But it's never actually the case that someone could come to visit spontaneously.
My husband is (unfortunately) no better either, it bothers me somewhere but mostly the household simply loses out to work and lack of interest.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more tidy with children?
We don't have one yet but we're working on it and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn't bother me that much as long as no visitors come and, for example, there are always fresh clothes and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have more motivation when you have a child or do you remain sloppy?
Looking forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I trained in the field of software development and have been fully trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I'm realizing more and more that this career isn't the right one for me, which is why I've been thinking about starting over and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have self-insecure (or anxious avoidant) personality disorder (ÄVPD).
Roughly speaking, this means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and I've been told many times that I seem aloof (although I think that's gotten better).
Can I become a social worker like this?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth club, but rather in addiction counseling or family support, for example.
But I don't know whether my everyday working life is really as I imagine it, and it's difficult to find anything about it on the Internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it brings me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("messing up the simplest things again") and I find it difficult to ask experienced colleagues for help to ask ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm keeping him from work with my stupid questions"/"He must really think I'm underprivileged" etc.).
I'll probably have these problems in every job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already gotten the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of this either.
I'm waiting for an appointment to pick it up
What do you mean by return please!
When I downloaded a book to #PRS_ORG#, I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
are there any problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I had received delivery confirmation for my closet.
The bird breaks down the protein it ingests with its food into individual protein building materials (amino acids) in its gastrointestinal tract and uses these to build up its own body proteins, which it also needs to form its feathers.
The formation of feathers in the nestling and the formation of new feathers in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high level of stress on the animal's entire organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, otherwise disruptions to the breeding process may occur.
Following this treatment administration of NEKTON-Bio, you should switch back to daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 g NEKTON-Bio to 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is advisable to only prepare as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
One level measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
In the case of severe plumage damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the beginning of new plumage formation is visible.
The normal dose is then given until the new plumage formation is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored in a dry place without exposure to sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to say my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement from a municipal employee contradicting the statutes
Hallo r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
So an application was submitted to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and therefore also walnuts is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I did not receive a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
yes, I think so, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident near Selb
A serious traffic accident recently occurred on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
As the police press alert currently reports (2:03 p.m.), a car drove into oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Ah, okay, I understand.
Well, thank you again for making it so easy!
Advice and ideas for your future career
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is mediocre because my dear head is currently thinking through everything that can be thought through.
Before I digress here... in short: I need advice and ideally from people who somehow know my situation - i.e. from you.
I'm currently doing the ref as a career changer.
I originally studied something else and also worked in a field there (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't say anything more specific here).
But the whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that might be more fun.
At some point I ended up teaching and was sure that was it - even if the conditions were much more inflexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I've now reached the third "I'll google other job advertisements".
And it's only been six months.
In the previous times I always decided to carry on and at least finish the ref, then I can always turn around.
But right now I'm absolutely exhausted.
I've had so little free time over the last month that I'm completely drained.
It's the holidays now, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was my weekend and my evening was my evening.
I had time off then.
And the stress at work didn't matter in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too stressful for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically it's fun and from the outside the ref is going well in terms of feedback and stuff.
But I'm completely drained and wondering how much stress my body can handle before it shuts down completely - if it doesn't already.
I'm wondering whether I want it to be like this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your posts here - or whether I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, and take some free time I could do it when I needed it and found the work somehow boring, but was paid appropriately and worked on something together in a team and not as a lone fighter, as is the case most of the time now.
But then I ask myself whether in a year I won't be back in the same place as I am now and be dissatisfied.
You can see that it's all kind of confusing, but maybe as an outsider you have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation where I'm completely exhausted and start to cry at the slightest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions that emotionally right now, it probably won't lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny tone in my tone.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, VOX's Valvetronix series has continued to evolve, including combining advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuitry to perfectly replicate the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art when it comes to sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits because they simply manage the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances bubble up.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily thanks to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then in order to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to another performance boost in the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and more numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: They expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the power amplifier in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and based on this finding they developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The Valve Reactor circuit of every VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances and tonal character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three Velcro dividers that can be individually placed and folded, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format SLR cameras.
Of course, what ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and lenses.
A possible configuration would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a speedlight.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models in the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses.
You can also store lots of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm XA or E series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photography things.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava flows have caused extensive damage on the Canary Islands.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, lasting 84 days.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the as yet unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past few days, but volcanologists still dare not predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," the island council's president, Mariano Hernández Zapata, told state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Millions of dollars in damage
In the almost three months since the eruption began, the lava, which has a temperature of more than 1,000 degrees, has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Cold lava created two new headlands off the coast with a total size of around 50 hectares.
Banana cultivation, which is extremely important for the island and from which around half of the 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was particularly badly affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and other areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper “El País”.
Christmas and the presents
Christmas is just around the corner and the children in particular can hardly wait for the heavenly celebration.
The many colorful presents under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still holds our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving gifts so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "social contract of primitive peoples", escapes the rigid routine and returns to it in the context of this tradition can be filled with life.
How Santa Claus became the Christ child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who closely linked Christmas with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were given to each other in one way or another on St. Nicholas Day.
The background to this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into three women's windows one night in order to spare them another life of sin.
This unconventional way of giving gave rise to the popular custom in Germany of filling the boots, especially of children, with gifts.
Protestants were offended by this custom because they rejected mediators between God and people as "veneration of saints."
For these reasons they object to the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ child and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, only a few people are upset that the custom of Saint Nicholas, like the St. Martin's custom with St. Martin's singing and the St. Martin's parade, is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today you can find everything your heart desires in boots on the doorstep and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources show a tradition of giving gifts on St. Nicholas Day since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a happy debate about the question of who will bring the presents to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region in question whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who is basically a kind of St. Nicholas, who has been given some characteristics over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the historical figure's rather strict Assyrian beard, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the wake of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for handing over the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near the royal palace
An armed man was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man walking into a bank and a bookmaker's shop with a gun.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by officers a short time later.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
There are several embassies in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light is easy to set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting time max. 10 hours.
- The robust plastic design can be used outdoors all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow colored inside.
“Smart Stone”, on the other hand, is completely harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light shines fascinatingly – either in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design was deliberately chosen: this modern light object appears like a naturally formed large pebble during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
It also does well around larger pebbles and boulders, where it can hold its own thanks to its size.
You can save yourself a lot of preparatory work: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« requires neither a power cable nor batteries.
Place the “luminous stone” anywhere that is exposed to the sun during the day.
Two ground spikes included ensure a firm hold if necessary.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides “Smart Stone” inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As dusk falls, “Smart Stone” begins to glow automatically; You decide for yourself which color: you can choose from six attractive light colors – in addition to daylight white.
The switch-off also occurs automatically as soon as the battery charge level has fallen to a specified minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I've done this several times and it doesn't work.
It's a shame, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the voucher isn't credited to me, then I won't order again as a matter of principle.

Pill problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post after a year on Reddit.
About my problem: I started taking the pill again out of necessity about five years ago, mainly because I had incredibly bad pain during my period and shitty PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it alone again because I have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I went from 0 to 100 on my last break of about two years and broke out explosively and everywhere.
So far so superficial, but it put a lot of stress on me and I didn't feel well.
During the two-year break, things never really returned to normal.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and no-nonsense, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me too seriously and my dermatologist appointment is still coming.
Thank you very much to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, dear skin is a thing.
I had severe neurodermatitis pre-uterine, then rested for a while, then large areas of wormwood and the issue of acne.
I also have nutrition in the course of chr. I tried everything possible when I was ill and stuck with a mixed diet of sugar, milk and low meat because nothing else worked really well.
It could also be that the hormonal problem is simply the problem, but if you're like me and have construction sites everywhere, you'd rather not go looking for anything else that's going wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague semina or similar.
Written and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what response was given to my request.
I always have to work and answer the phone in between and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check? If the money were there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but it is generally available in large

In the name of the people: Lay people make judgments
In the courtroom they sit on the judge's bench in everyday clothing.
But a lot depends on their verdict, even if they don't wear a robe: lay judges, together with professional judges, determine whether and for how long someone goes behind bars.
Two of them reported in an interview with the "Oeffentlichen" about their time at the Bad Kreuznach regional court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the regional court on John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.
Hello, unfortunately I can't access the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice from the order number #NUMBER# again to the email address given above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We have no way of storing them for that long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were ours
Gladly, I had already ordered the same armchair in blue in November and received it. Because they are so beautiful, I would now have one in gray
Does the cabinet have to be completely dismantled for collection and refund?
and when would pickup be?
110 kV underground cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for laying the new high-voltage cable near Tann is legally binding.
The planning approval decision by the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now announced this.
The approximately seven kilometer long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the community and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to an overhead line mast near the town of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from January 3rd, 2021 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts.
The blue order number: #PRS_ORG# with the tracking number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
A nice start into the week!
You can forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a dresser made of glass and all of the sides are cracked open, so there is glass everywhere and the box is broken
The chest of drawers is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# regulations
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment
Thank you for your message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's the case with all books, hence the request to #PRS_ORG#, as it's probably a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I've been in the department since the summer, I enjoy teaching, but I'm currently still having a lot of problems planning my geography lessons in a time-efficient manner.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped at all, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook and an OHP as a medium.
At school I can only copy b/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
It's currently just taking me a long time to plan my lessons.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geofactors and for me each hour is actually on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest an excessive amount of time in simple lessons (I also need that for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (I usually create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Hence the worksheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work with the book in a time-efficient manner.
Would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one from #PRS_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as quickly as possible.
Retailers are worried about Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
Only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered are allowed into most stores.
Retailers believe this is unnecessary and complain about a drop in sales.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are spoiling the important Christmas business for retailers.
HDE managing director Stefan Genth criticized a drop in sales in stores selling non-everyday items.
According to a current HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies had a negative outlook on the remaining days of the year.
Many have already written off the Christmas business.
“What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless hole,” said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Things are only going well in food retail and online.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with a mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the general manager.
“2G when shopping won’t get us any further in the fight against the pandemic,” he emphasized.
The current regulations put off customers and required a lot of staff.
The wristband regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, every customer only has to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops on that day with the wristband they received.
In addition, in retail - as in local public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Frequencies were recently at a good 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and sales were around 90 percent.
These numbers will now certainly fall in the middle of the all-important Christmas business,” said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to “Wirtschaftswoche”.
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find solutions and get them approved.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, in which "visitors, for example, provide their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed." dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS_ORG# and had it delivered.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a flaw on the frame, which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already put it back in the package and taped it shut.
What do I have to do now to return it?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with extraordinary options ensures that the color temperature and brightness of the lamp are adjusted.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to use.
The lamp produces a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The beam angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust brightness with virtually no change in color temperature.
It's a great tool for working on a film set or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller enables remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the light is the control panel, which consists of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To configure the individual settings in the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons and you're done.
The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that the familiar situation is restored when it is switched on again - very practical when working in the studio, for example. the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with batteries One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality comes from the possibility of operating it with inexpensive NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - a battery tester is built in - a value for each of the two battery compartments in the two displays (the left battery on the upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power using the included power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm sleeve as a connection for attachment, so you can connect directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted using locks on both sides.
Care was taken to ensure that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for longevity and tough use.
A tilt joint is also included in the scope of delivery.
It's great that a bag is included in the scope of delivery.
This means you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
It's a shame, I got it as a gift and it's too small :(
“Party we wanted to throw”: Frankfurt celebrates after a high-scoring comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had recently won twice in a row, were apparently on the way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned up the heat, got rid of their frustration over a mixed start to the season within a good hour and won furiously 5-2. “It’s crazy what the boys did today,” cheered coach Oliver Glasner at DAZN and gave “blanket praise to everyone who was there.”
At the beginning it looked like there would be another setback for the Frankfurt team, who were now in ninth place and still below their expectations.
Patrik Schick gave Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What happened next also impressed the SGE trainer.
“How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance,” continued Glasner.
I'm incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to be back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday after recovering from a muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
“I think our mentality is unbelievably great,” said the 27-year-old and was particularly happy for the spectators when he looked at the result.
This was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself for the upcoming tasks, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are in top physical shape.
It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live a highly professional life.
Now they want to “go further step by step and remain modest” and “carry out the tasks at this level” until the turn of the year.
Next on the agenda is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6.30 p.m., Sky) on Wednesday as part of the English week.
I just received the email that my package was being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried calling #PRS_ORG# and having it redirected, no luck.
Can it be re-shipped to me directly or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately for me that would mean that I wouldn't order again because it had already taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Setback for handball women before the quarter-finals against Spain
After the humiliation against Denmark, Germany's handball women sneaked off the floor with hanging heads and empty looks.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a bitter defeat at 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face hosts Spain in the quarter-finals.
“We were far too scared and had too much respect for the opponent,” said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to perform differently against Spain.
After their first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second in the main round group III with 8:2 points behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
"It was a bad game by everyone that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement must be made against the 2019 World Cup runner-up next Tuesday in order to keep the tender dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German thrower in the duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
Not up to par from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not up to speed at kick-off.
Missed throws and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 4-0 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and made a few saves to prevent anything worse from happening.
The DHB team scored their first goal after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, this was not the initial spark we had hoped for.
The German women were hardly able to assert themselves against the aggressive defense of the Danes - and when they did, they usually failed because of the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Scandinavians' goal.
So the game ended early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backcourt player Mia Zschocke also saw red a little later for a hard foul on her opponent.
But she can take part again in the quarterfinals.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection got into the game a little better and at least scored five goals by the break.
The only faint hope of catching up after the change was gone after just seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, Groener's protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for their opponents, who were in a good mood and were among the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer bring themselves to improve their performance and left the floor as clear losers.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family traditions during the Christmas season

What was it like at home back then?
Like with your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the best thing for the children?
The boot polishing?
Bake cookies?
Decorate the tree?
Is there music being played?
Is Santa Claus, the Christ Child, coming or is the present from grandma and grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort during and around Christmas to make it as nice as possible as a family.
Whether these are fixed traditions, or even something different every year: tell us how things worked or are going in your family!
please send me any transaction number.. or anything else that might help
Transfer confirmation... etc
I would like to give away a voucher code
like with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
does that work for you?
The title says it all, I work as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered, especially in nursing homes.
Since most of these will soon be finished, some of the work will then continue for me in vaccination centers.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not related to you personally (e.g. "I am taking medication X, is it compatible with the vaccination...").
My area of responsibility includes providing information about the vaccination, the indication (the person is entitled to a vaccination according to the Corona Vaccination Ordinance and there are no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, emergency care in the event of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, however, we often don't have any with us, but "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who cannot (are not allowed to?) carry out vaccinations, so I carry out most of the vaccinations myself .
Difficult “Huidlerer” question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a “Huidlerer”?
This dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, caused a lot of thought in the BR television program “We in Bavaria”.
But unlike many previous days, the term remained in the series "Host mi?" this time undetected by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "person who is nervous."
And also no one “for whom everything has to happen quickly”.
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
Whereupon the man from Amberg announced the solution, which probably surprised many Upper Palatinate residents.
“The Huidlerer,” the audience learned, “is a rag that someone uses to wipe out the oven.”
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
This closed an educational gap - probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, restarted, connected to the PC, synced and repaired.
Nothing helped.
Choosing tires for a racing bike - really so puncture-proof?
This morning I woke up full of energy because I wanted to do at least a little training in preparation for my bike ride next week.
No sooner said than done and I set off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then something happened that lurks in every city center (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Splinters of glass on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire definitely didn't want to take part in the rest of the route.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement coat and tube due to it being a weekday, I had to turn around in a somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't that bad in terms of mood, maybe it would be better if I practice changing tires again before the bike ride.
But now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route ahead of me over several days, I would hate to have this problem again and again.
Now it really wasn't bad, as the previous owner also had the old tires (very nice old man, tore off 120km by 2 p.m. on the day I came to pick up the bike!) and he had already described them as suboptimal because he rode with them on rollers for several years.
But when I think about having to change tires after 80-90km while driving, I think I'm in a really bad mood :D
Now I started talking to an older man on the platform who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; These are supposed to be unflattenable.
Now of course the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really that indestructible?
I have little desire to spend €40 per tire just to be disappointed.
I'm also wondering: I think I have a 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment.
These are also (apparently?) available with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally recommend different tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe site seems to me absolute! Should laypeople recommend the Durano DD?
Thanks in advance for the help and kind regards!

After the release of our new high-end broadband B 100-6 OHM, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series had new blood again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the larger models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
Due to the principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom the maximum volume plays a minor role, but for whom an exceptionally high level of sound is to be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to produce such high sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, that doesn't mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she appears considerably mature and extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
Tonally, the SOLO 15 was tuned with a slight treble increase.
This is generally common practice with broadbands in order to optimize bundling, which increases sharply at high frequencies.
Aligned precisely to the listening position, the SOLO 15 impresses with its very clear and fine sound.
Turned slightly outwards, the high-frequency range can be reduced, making the sound warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and amazingly precise.
The reference-worthy extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure a fine dynamic that is second to none.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our kits, it is advisable to start by thinking about the final appearance of the speaker in order to plan for appropriate changes during construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housing, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer adds more material.
After all the panels have been cut to size (e.g. at the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the base panel at the appropriate point so that the cable can be fed through there later without any problems.
With the help of a router, the loudspeaker opening is now made in the front so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
On the back, this opening should be provided with a 45° chamfer in order to make the opening area of the speaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw points of the B 100 - 6 OHM have an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the picture “Detail chamfer”.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the base are now glued onto this.
The three stiffeners should also be inserted and glued together.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, for example if you want to use ready-made strips from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
The next step is to attach the second page.
This is followed by all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides and the front.
Using a suitable hole saw or a Forstner drill bit makes it easier to attach the openings of the bass reflex tube and the connecting terminal to the rear wall.
You then use a round milling cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off with this.
The base plate is then firmly glued to the base of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wood screws.
This is followed by marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) the screw connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuum/blow out), start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
To do this, push the entire, uncut cable piece by piece through the 8 mm hole in the base to the terminal opening and let it protrude approx. 30 cm from there.
In the upper part of the housing, lead the cable to the speaker opening and let it hang loosely there too.
The crossover is then prepared and used.
The construction plan of the crossover and the corresponding connection diagram can be found in the following document: Installation instructions for the Solo 15 crossover.
Once the crossover is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing follows the 8 mm cable opening inside the box, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bass REFLEX opening and with a little skill, you can drip hot glue onto the opening and close it.
You can check the seal accordingly by opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and using a small lamp.
Now the damping follows as described.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed tight with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so the positive cable (marked cable) must be soldered to the positive pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept clear.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
>Hello everyone,
> We can finally announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> For known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which meant more planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people tuning in, so we will be watching the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - but we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Get your drinks cold, plan some good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
