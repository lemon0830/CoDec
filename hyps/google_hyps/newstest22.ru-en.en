From my point of view, the literature program was formed by ladies of Balzac's age based on their interests.
Of Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those same ladies of Balzac's age.
But the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Mattress Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Model "Micropackage Prestige": comfort and natural composition.
The mattress has different hardness of the sides: a medium-hard surface is formed by latexed coconut fiber and natural latex, a moderately soft surface is formed by a slab of natural latex.
A spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the sleeper’s body, preventing the appearance of a “wave” or “hammock” effect.
Among the advantages of the model, it is necessary to highlight breathable materials.
Latex, perforated for breathability, ventilates naturally as does coconut coir.
Thanks to this, a healthy microclimate in the sleeping area is maintained.
The mattress also comes with an extended warranty period.
The official warranty period from the manufacturer is 5 years; in fact, the lifespan of the mattress is longer.
Protection from dust and dirt is provided by the removable jacquard cover supplied in the kit.
Purchase an orthopedic pillow to pair with your mattress – it is recommended for maintaining optimal spinal position during sleep.
The filler determines the purpose of the sides - coconut serves as anatomical support for the back, latex relaxes the muscles.

So no support.
I remember with horror these feasts and guests in my parents’ house.
The guests are on the doorstep, and the cutlets are still finishing cooking on the stove, and the disheveled mother is mopping the floor.
Lord, I was already sitting down at the table exhausted.
And then wash the dishes and clean the house.
A week before the holiday you carry groceries, two days of cooking, a day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
It’s good for them, and be sure to take the cake with them.
Since then I don’t like holidays or guests.
Even for my family I set the table at minimum wage.
And I prepare delicious treats for them, I bake them very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccine imminent
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed vigor.
Despite Germany's active vaccination campaign, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
Die Welt reported this on Saturday, December 11.
“We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, or at the latest in the fall,” the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be administered “in combination with a flu vaccination.”
This will help you achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination may help combat the spread of the new Omicron coronavirus strain.
Moreover, the new variant is especially dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, manufacturers BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection by the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: “neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
“This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain,” BioNTech and Pfizer emphasized.
Therefore, a third dose is necessary.
Experts insist that the pace of vaccinations in the country be accelerated.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, advocates reducing the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience shows this very convincingly,” the expert emphasized.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created with use in mind for ice fishing, and not just for casting.
These vibes have a greater specific gravity than similar sized analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal movements.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing vertically, the Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy animation is a simple monotonous animation, that is, moving the fishing rod up and down with almost no pauses.
When gliding, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space cluttered with underwater vegetation, snags and other obstacles that can get caught.
In addition, a slight deviation is important when fishing for pike perch and large perch in winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when a targeted and aggressive presentation of bait is required.
Having reached the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is no less successfully used for winter fishing for pond trout.
To please her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It was also noted that Bet-A-Vib, by playing a plumb line, is capable of irritating a passive pike that does not even respond to live bait.
When casting, the Bet-A-Vib delivers range and accuracy.
This wobbler is clear and not capricious; it goes well with fishing line and braided cords of even large diameters.
For casting fishing for pike, pike perch, ruffe or perch, in addition to a uniform one, a “step” is also relevant, sometimes with a “strike” along the bottom.
If you are fishing in snags, you can change the front treble to a double, which will reduce the likelihood of snags.
Among the lures of its class, Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in operation and, as a result, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success both in relatively shallow and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya, they announced 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
There are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the private military company (PMC) Wagner in Libya.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
“Currently, there are more than 7 thousand mercenaries of the Wagner PMC in Libya.
They also have airplanes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Ghardabiya air bases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte),” Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries are "trying to take over" central Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they "put their man in power" in the Central African Republic.
Maintain presence
According to the publication’s interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “settled in Libya.”
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, the agency noted in the publication.
Russian authorities officially deny that Wagner PMC is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else could there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine African countries - Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection for leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use minerals and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technology and military services to these countries,” the article says.
According to the media, the “Wagnerites” allegedly fought in the Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed either in the law enforcement agencies or in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not included in the personnel lists.
This company is under US sanctions.
Let us remind you that earlier the permanent representatives of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
The Council of the European Union is expected to approve this decision on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with the Islamists dominating it, TASS writes.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of the single voting day for the elections of members of parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
“There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will be held on time are rapidly decreasing,” the material notes.
Against this background, the High Election Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures predominate.
“Examples of success - “they protected Syria, restored peace there”, “the decision on Nord Stream 2”, “the whole world was intimidated, what a cool weapon”, “We squeezed out Crimea.”
The main failures are “the conflict with Ukraine,” “confrontation with Western countries,” and “isolation from the world,” says a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paperwork - all government services have also become digital only
The Dubai government has announced a complete abandonment of paperwork and a transition to digital technology.
All government services to the population will also be provided exclusively electronically.
This was reported by the Emirates news agency WAM.
“Today marks the beginning of a new phase in the digitalization of all aspects of life in Dubai - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government,” Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of the emirate and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, said on Saturday.
Now internal and external document flow in all government agencies in Dubai will be carried out only digitally through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitalization of document flow began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, as the authorities calculated, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which amounts to 14 million hours of human labor and $353.8 million in monetary equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey's car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November as the lira depreciated.
As a result, the industry's performance for 11 months turned out to be worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115 thousand cars were produced from factories in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75.9 thousand vehicles were exported, which is more than 25% lower than last year’s figure.
And if, based on the results of the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish automotive sector showed positive dynamics compared to last year, then based on the results of 11 months of 2021, car production was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this drop was the sharp depreciation of the Turkish lira, which fell by 29% against the dollar in November.
This led to a drop in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received a deferment on loan payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, a Kazinform correspondent reports.
"According to the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market, this year, in pursuance of the order of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, Order No. 127 of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 was adopted "On approval of the Procedure for granting deferred payments on loans to small and medium-sized entities business,” Alikhan Smailov wrote in his response to a deputy’s request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferred payments on loans provided for the provision by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities of deferred payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including individual entrepreneurs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferment period ranged from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME.
The borrower's application could indicate a different deferment period.
During the deferment period, claims work against the borrower, notification of the need to repay overdue debt, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the lender were suspended,” the deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, second-tier banks received applications for deferment of loan payments from 603 SME borrowers, of which 553 SMEs received a deferment in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SMEs submitted applications for deferment to microfinance organizations, of which 95 entities were granted deferment in the amount of 105.8 million tenge,” concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immune systems can easily tolerate the Okmiron strain
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the Okmiron strain of coronavirus can be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions under which the virus originated.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of someone infected with HIV or suffering from immunodeficiency.
That is, during the mutation he did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
Due to this, he is more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from the immune system, it became very fast.
Apparently, he has more of these spike proteins there than he should have, their antibodies were not cut down during mutations,” comments pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems can tolerate “okmiron” more easily than those who have a strong body’s defense reaction.
It turns out that the body’s strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-old young people die, and 60-year-old people suffer it in the form of a sneeze.
The young man’s immune response is frantic, it is completely inadequate: where one could only wag a finger, it hits sparrows like a cannon,” concluded Sergei Puryasev.
The doctor also recalled that coronavirus has dangerous side effects, and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case it is often possible to stop only the symptoms - all hope is in the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - fever, weakness, malaise.
Then come respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain may also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, by the end of the year they can begin to vaccinate the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old.
Virologist, head of the MIPT laboratory of genomic engineering Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active stratum, just like kindergarten students,” Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the MIPT laboratory of genomic engineering, told Moscow 24.
Many thanks to the author for this article.
I enjoyed refreshing my memories...
Teath-In.
In those distant seventies and eighties, not a single dance floor was complete without the tunes of this group.
And at home, getting together with friends, they danced to their music.
Immunologists have hypothesized why obese people become victims of Covid
The authors studied fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells known as adipocytes can become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, were also infected and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who died from Covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system's response.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of this too.
Biologist spoke about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome manifests itself as a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person finds it difficult to navigate even in familiar surroundings.
Golosheikin noted that most often neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role,” he said.
The development of dementia is also influenced by addictions such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disturbances and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
“There is a debate that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence,” the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the required level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution of Higher Education Russian National Research Medical University named after.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the department of cognitive disorders at the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology, Anna Bogolepova, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returned about 30 thousand artifacts illegally taken from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return home about 30 thousand artifacts that were illegally smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
"This year alone, 5,300 ancient Egyptian artifacts were discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
Now department employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists “monitor auctions around the world and sales on the Internet” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural property is restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities turned to Interpol with a request to help find a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
On July 4, Christie's auction house held an auction in which a bust over 3 thousand years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused discontent on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the piece of art was illegally removed from the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of ancient monuments illegally taken from the country at different times.
According to authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological research by “black diggers.”
“The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account” - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people - that’s how many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to gain access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the USA, a Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, a bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank uses the right to review mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to resolve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin’s life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the poet’s earthly existence and his “ego”.
He is already outside of any literary associations, he has given up on imagism, he is on his own, but he is known, in demand, at times we are strongly criticized by critics, even angrily, but the reading public is ready to carry him in their arms.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle “Persian Motifs” was completed, the poem “Anna Snegina” was written, 8 books were published, the collection “Soviet Rus'” was published.
And the main success - at the end of June 25, Gosizdat entered into an agreement with Yesenin to publish his works in 3 volumes.
None of the contemporary poets of Sergei Alexandrovich received such an honor, he was the first!
In addition, this promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles monthly for 20 months (the plant director, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed that year more than ever.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy’s granddaughter Sofya Tolstoy; it was necessary to arrange family life, support his sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as his mother.
It seems that life is getting better, there is something to be happy about, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark tones, as if a nightmare from the poem “The Black Man” (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin’s death) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I am very, very sick.
I don’t know where this pain came from.
Is the wind whistling
Over an empty and deserted field,
Just like a grove in September,
Alcohol showers your brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had lost his strength, looked bad, and was clearly ill.
Binge drinking and nervous breakdowns are becoming more and more frequent.
And the reason is probably not only alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was given to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
Let's say, dating back to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Isadora Duncan, was improving his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Pyotr Gannushkin (Yesenin would see him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But there is plenty of evidence of the poet’s drinking bouts, scandals on this basis, and arrests with the police - scattered across dozens of memoirs.
From the beginning of the 20s, the poet’s terrible romance with the green serpent developed rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin lived for a short time with a friend, imagist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own home either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg; he lived in rented apartments, in hotels, or with friends.
Startsev recalls:
“He only came to spend the night, and in most cases in an insane, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o'clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and wheezed.
Having come to his senses a little, he began coughing continuously, spattering blood all over the sheet..."
And Yesenin himself, after a voyage across Europe and the USA (there was prohibition in the States at that time, but Duncan took a decent supply of alcohol with her) admitted:
“I didn’t see anything there except taverns and streets...
Towards the end I stopped remembering people...
Well, he drank, of course...
And I drank because the melancholy bit me.”

Now my son is almost 16, and he is no longer tormented by the desire to fool around.
All energy is directed towards choosing what he will do for a living.
He is much more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who periodically had problems with the law before the wedding.
A father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, “with a strange love.”
Why did the girl cry during the exam when she had not yet failed it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that this was not a school?
Well, she will have a tail.
So what?
Will retake.
Millions of students know this.
What are we even talking about?
The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as a “weapon” against the EU
The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as “weapons”
Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland Pavel Jablonski expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made a corresponding statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review newspaper.
According to Yablonsky, sanctions against Belarus have temporarily “stopped Lukashenko,” but he is “actively searching for new ways.”
The Polish official is also confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons “in many parts of the world.”
As the website kp.ru wrote, earlier the European Union introduced a fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe has declared its readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic “if the situation in the country does not improve.”
Minsk responded by introducing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

“It’s not Senka’s hat”: when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughing stock
Velvet jackets have dominated social events in 2021.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion decision was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film No Time to Die, he appeared in a velvet crimson jacket and a traditional Bond bow tie.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not comply with the royal dress code at The Earthshot Prize ceremony, and then chose a more classic option for an event in support of the Royal Variety charity foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messiah tried on the trend.
The footballer came to collect his seventh Ballon d'Or wearing a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same ones.
AliExpress is already noticing growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to service analysts received by Gazeta.Ru, they began to be purchased 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with lining and a fitted silhouette; the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are presented in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, which brand ambassador Jared Leto wore to one of the premieres of the film “The House of Gucci.”
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to a special technology of weaving threads, a dense fabric with a fleecy outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made from cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, they last less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but its appropriateness.
“Velvet requires evening light, so this jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or special event,” explains Vakhoshkin. “It is also suitable for those cases where the dress code “Black Tie” or “Creative Black Tie” is indicated on the invitation.
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
“A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, must acquire the right advanced party with income,” say the authors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion “Handsome Brummell.” “Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets .
They are simply invited to special social events, where a dress code is always specified.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic trousers with creases, plain shirts, silk ties, loafers with tassels, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from Handsome Brummell are sure that it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee to appear in a velvet jacket at a corporate party, but if we are talking about “a manager from among those who run this event, then yes, such a thing suits him.” .
If the employee is of a lower rank, and his goal is to move higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or to get financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely appreciate this with the phrase “that’s not Senka’s hat,” say the editors of the Telegram channel about men’s fashion.
Very ambiguous sensations from the voice.
This is an unnatural timbre, it’s so forced.
And it is not at all associated with the sweet face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don’t understand the admiration of others.
But with all my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It's all about money - alternative energy is well lobbied for, that is, paid for.
Billions of dollars in investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has increased.
Traditional energy is also not at a loss - gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are now selling.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
The penny is dripping.
Who's on the way then?
As usual - an ordinary buyer.
Do the Indians' problems concern the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who “slept through” the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good bribe.
I didn’t see a single handsome person in the photos in the article.
Just mediocrity within the framework of average passengers.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole carriage, then most likely they will not sit down with them.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such “handsome men”, but definitely not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, “a slave who is aware of his slave position and fights against it is a revolutionary.
A slave who is not aware of his slavery and vegetates in a silent, unconscious and wordless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave whose mouth waters when he smugly describes the delights of slave life and admires his kind and good master is a slave, a boor.”
The immunologist said that revaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the “omicron” strain of coronavirus
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection "omicron".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called vaccination after six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, “a very long period”
“With previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases - after four,” the expert said, calling for revaccination in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person received two vaccinations and a booster, or he got sick and was vaccinated, or was vaccinated and got sick, then he received “hybrid immunity,” that is, there are a lot of antibodies and enough neutralizing ones,” the expert clarified.
G7 warns Russia of 'massive consequences' if it invades Ukraine
The G7 countries (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) published a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have enormous consequences and will be costly" for Moscow, but the document does not describe specific measures.
"We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine," the statement said.
The ministers further call on Russia to “de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding transparency of military activities,” as US President Biden spoke about during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the G7 foreign ministers also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have enormous consequences and a serious cost in return,” they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, British diplomatic chief Elizabeth Truss said Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
She said the meeting showed "a united voice from the G7 countries, which account for 50% of global GDP, and have made it very clear that an invasion of Ukraine would have enormous consequences for Russia."
The Pfizer vaccine was considered 32 times less effective against the omicron strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was considered less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug against COVID-19.
"We see that most people had a high level of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists emphasized that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the influence of the omicron strain on it.
The study authors concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense accused Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kyiv
The head of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, Alexey Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev’s acquisition of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
It is noted that Berlin later softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the Minister of Defense, Kyiv intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the USA, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding allowing arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Andriy Melnik expressed the opinion that Kyiv should not expect arms supplies from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of a military escalation of the conflict in Donbass, despite the “occupation by Russia” of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is sure that Germany will retain the same “illogical” position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said that Kyiv expected help from Berlin in equipping its navy.
Ukraine expects that Germany “will be Ukraine’s partner in a technical sense,” the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kyiv.

Years... many years ago I made the same redevelopment.
Combined the living room with the kitchen.
Three-room apartment.
Was.
Of course, a project, a permit, a new registration certificate, everything is according to the law.
In the hallway they made a bookcase and a large dressing room.
The door to the kitchen was blocked, and there was a lot of space.
For almost 10 years of living in this apartment, we have never regretted what we did.
One of the mistakes was that instead of a bathtub they installed a cool shower stall.
I regretted it a hundred times!
I only recently realized that I love rum.
But I have not yet discovered the wonderful world of rum for myself, except for Bacardi and Captain Morgan.
What else would you recommend, and where could we start this wonderful acquaintance?
I got sick too.
I will not get vaccinated.
I came to Chernomorskoye for “rehabilitation”.
Only the weather was unlucky...

Plus, paint and other chemical compounds will repel birds.
Only natural materials and natural colors.
Thanks, I'll definitely try it.
And what does Japan have to do with it?
Thanks for the recipe.
What types of apples should be used for this recipe?
It's really delicious.
I add a little more onion and a green apple.
Give it a try.
Recently, a zombie guy said that car production is experiencing an unprecedented shortage of semiconductors.
A table appeared on the screen showing which country produces what percentage of these semiconductors (apparently microcontroller chips).
Russia was not on this list.
Like this!
In the USA, with their expensive labor force, it is profitable, but here in Russia, it is unprofitable!
And my mother-in-law tormented me.
I feel sorry for her, she is not with us.
If I had seen good things from her, everything could have been different.
But apart from hatred, gossip, scandals, there is nothing special to remember.
I feel sorry for her, she lived her life in anger.
Mercedes lodges a protest against the result of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix

Mercedes believes that Formula 1 rules 48.12 and 48.8 were violated during the race.

G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, the parties stated in the final statement.
The meeting participants also noted that they condemn the strengthening of Russian armed forces near the country’s borders.
“Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs,” the UK government said in a statement.
The ministers of the G7 countries and the EU High Representative noted that they are “unified in their condemnation of Russian military reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine.”
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned at a press conference in Liverpool of “big consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to renounce its aggression towards Ukraine,” she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier at the Liverpool summit, G7 foreign ministers agreed that to resolve the crisis due to the buildup of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
The talk was about negotiations in the Normandy format.
The North Atlantic Alliance also supported dialogue on Ukraine in the Normandy format.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries “signed their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes.”

Methods for returning money stolen through online stores have been revealed
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of large losses if bank card data falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to store fixed assets on a card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Part of your savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend having a separate card for online purchases.
If money was stolen during purchases in stores that do not use 3D Secure security technology, you can initiate a refund procedure.
“Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility rests with the participant in the settlement chain who does not use this service,” a representative of Promsvyazbank clarified.
An expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Arthur Zaremba, emphasized that the buyer has the right to submit an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if a criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, member of the Public Chamber and director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand requests were received regarding various cases of fraud: from the sale of counterfeit documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints against online fraudsters.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz has stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years to come, the two leaders have expressed clear expectations from each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which would carry Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin said it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
Poland's judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its highest court ruled that national legislation took precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, has not publicly committed to stopping Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine.
US officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior US congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border, a position reiterated by G7 officials on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more carefully.
The view outside the window is the same, the size of the window has not changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room was removed, so the second window is partially visible.
In general, those who are not familiar with the initial layout have doubts.
But I know such apartments very well and I can see perfectly well how they remodeled it.
May everything be fine for them.
It’s always surprising when they write about means to clean the sink, toilet, window sills, and taps.
You wash them once a year at Easter, so you have to wash them straight away.
Just don't let it get dirty.
The Ministry of Digital Development wants to provide writers with residences
The state will transfer to the future Fund for the Support of Russian Writers the federal property inherited from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR.
Writers' residences will be created on its basis, the Ministry of Digital Development, which will become the founder of the fund, told the Parliamentary Newspaper.

The draft decree instructs to reflect in the Foundation's charter that it "is created in order to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers."
“By ‘creating conditions for creative activity’ we mean the creation, on the basis of transferred property in different regions of Russia, of writer’s residences in which there would be comfortable conditions for creativity,” the Ministry of Digital Development explained to our publication.

Doctors warned about the dangers of long-term use of blood thinning drugs after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartseva and Sergei Tokarev warned about the danger of uncontrolled use of blood-thinning drugs after contracting the coronavirus infection COVID-19 and before vaccination against coronavirus.
Therapist, immunologist Irina Yartseva said that self-prevention of possible blood clots after COVID-19 can trigger a stroke.
Yartseva explained that blood-thinning drugs are not intended for everyone, only if the patient was hospitalized, was in the hospital, and complications were identified.
The doctor prescribes anticoagulants (blood-thinning medications that prevent excessive blood clots) according to indications.
She said that obscurantism is happening now - everyone is taking anticoagulants for a long time and getting complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding in the brain).
The chief preventive specialist of the Urals Federal District, scientific director of the Society of Preventive Medicine Specialists, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergei Tokarev, in an interview with URA.RU, said that Russians now often use anticoagulants indiscriminately even before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and begin to self-medicate.
There are some citizens who, by their own decision, start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And during a preliminary examination before vaccination, doctors notice bruises.
He emphasized that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found the money in the wall of the church will be paid 20 thousand dollars
The plumber who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will receive a reward.
This was reported in a press release from the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at the large evangelical Lakewood Church, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising wealth and prosperity for devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was renovating one of the church's toilets when he discovered thousands of bags containing cash and checks under the insulation.
He gave the find to the church and, according to him, did not even receive a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," he was quoted as saying by KPRC-TV.
The discovery appears to be related to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks that were kept in a church safe then went missing.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of 25 thousand dollars was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount because the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated five thousand dollars for the reward and later received another $20 thousand as a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He will receive 20 thousand dollars.
Earlier it was reported that police questioned Pastor Joel Osteen about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic “as a real person.”
That is why the attitude towards her is so negative.
And the point is not that “she is financially much richer than all the hacks,” as they write here.
There are richer people, but not everyone behaves as brazenly, as defiantly as this madam.

Brazil requires citizens to present vaccination passports when entering the country
Brazil has made it mandatory to require Covid-19 passports from those entering the country, a corresponding decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF), Luis Roberto Barroso.
CNN Brasil reports this.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a vaccination certificate.
Also included in the list of exceptions are persons arriving from countries where there is a proven lack of vaccine.
"The situation is even more serious when we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-Carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flows," Barroso said.
Previously, the Brazilian authorities obliged tourists who were not vaccinated against coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
A scheme for complete protection against COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, revealed a scheme for complete protection against coronavirus infection.
This can be achieved through injection and nasal vaccine, he said.
When administered internally, large quantities of immunoglobulins A are formed. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we produce the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you administer both vaccines, you will receive a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no decision yet on double vaccination,” the doctor said.
The chief preventive specialist of the Urals Federal District, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergei Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this will help because in this case the body’s protection should presumably become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, David Melik-Guseinov, said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children would lead to a new surge in the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is precisely the picture observed in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic arrived earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I talked to a male dog (who died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to exchange a warm home, feeding, affection, love and games for a bitch in heat, then go ahead.
But the dog was trained and generally smart.
He chose my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works in 90% of cases.
It wasn’t pulled out of thin air, believe me.
I stopped many owners so that they wouldn’t run after the dog, although they were wailing that there were 200 thousand running away (Pomskies), I literally took them by the hand and led them in the other direction.
As a result, “200 thousand” chose the owner, and not the dog, which was running somewhere out there.
Mass anti-vaccination protests continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and the authorities’ plans to make vaccination against Covid mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the authorities' health policies, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs with the words “This is a false pandemic” and “I will not get vaccinated.”
A major protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, a Covid certificate is required for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife venues.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of a number of regions of the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against tightening restrictive measures and QR codes.
The protest began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolay S., even on Wikipedia there is no consensus on this matter.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as “the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine,” probably because she started studying earlier.
Let's just not argue, I think they both deserve the title.
There is only one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans brought only death and plunder to any country wherever they appeared.

WHO has discovered "omicron" in sixty countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of coronavirus “omicron” has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was described in a WHO message.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain had already been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to actively spread only from the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the “delta” strain in terms of spread, also known as the Indian variant of coronavirus, which is now leading in absolutely all countries without exception.
Prior to this, the Director General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were also reached in the UK.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that “omicron” will displace “delta” in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially several hundred people in the Kingdom are currently suffering from “omicron”, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, and at its peak, more than 2 thousand people will be taken to hospitals every day.
Something the British healthcare system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is still unknown how the Russian Sputnik V reacts to the “omicron” - this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine using the Omicron strain.
Why do we need to see the stages of aging?
It would be better to SEE the execution of your exercises in more detail.
In the first exercise, it is not clear how to do it: sitting on your heels or standing on your knees, as it is written, but how then can you rest your hands on your hips?
Or hands on your waist?
Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is completely different, they communicate easily and naturally, but in a personal meeting there is nothing to say.
Yes, and seeing a person live, perhaps it’s not what you expected, it didn’t hook you - hence the attitude.
When he meets his person, then his views will change.
And again, Soviet times are called “the time of demons.”
Yes, then people believed in God much more honestly than today.
And they were brought up practically according to God’s laws (love your neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What is the ideology today - money at any cost.
Chatterboxes like Globa have little faith (indeed, none at all), but even if so, then the time of demons came in the 90s...
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad communal apartment with Bolshaya Zelenina still maintains communication.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but we try to maintain the warmth of relations between the older generation.
Perhaps this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, rooms were not rented out, and no one canceled the siege brotherhood.
Unfortunately, we see each other more and more often at funerals.
Lara Angelskaya, come on!
Human cubs, especially males, are strong, active, energetic, they rage, push, wrestle, fight, just like their little “brothers” in nature!
The only pity is that they are not as soft as puppies or kittens, so bruises, bumps, scratches are common, but not a boomerang!
And why?
Did you push your brother without calculating the strength?
Are you always so clever that you never accidentally hurt anyone and never injured yourself?

$135 billion went to applications - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending in apps grew by 25% worldwide and downloads by 8%.
Various video services turned out to be the most popular in the world.
Users downloaded the video editor CapCut the most and spent the most on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending on them showed significant growth between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. User spending in applications increased even more significantly: by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.
“Will such a ‘return to physical’ slow down the growth of the app economy? Not at all,” say the report’s authors.
India has become the leader in the number of application downloads: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the USA (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of gadgets on iOS, as before, spent more than users on Android: iOS accounted for 65% of all spending in applications.
Among applications, the video editor CapCut took first place in the number of downloads in 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps: MX video service TakaTak and online trading app Meesho.
Telegram is also in the top 10 by number of downloads.
In general, judging by the number of downloads, VPN services are popular among users (there are two of them in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to video creation and broadcasting (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, the top 10 also includes two such services are Moj and SnackVideo).
“Users spent the most money on live broadcasting and online streaming apps,” note the report’s authors.
YouTube is the leader here; the top 5 in terms of user spending also includes the video service TikTok, streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.
The first places in terms of the number of monthly active users are occupied by Telegram, Instagram, Zoom and TikTok, and the mobile version of Microsoft Office closes the top 5.
In Russia, the leader in the number of downloads per year was the AliExpress shopping application.
It is followed by the Zenly service, which shows the location of friends, and the same CapCut.
Also in the top 10 applications are: online karaoke StarMaker, online clothing retailer Shein, Maps for Minecraft PE application, online taxi ordering service DiDi, YouTube client Pure Tuber, retailer application "Dixie" and online store "Samokat" .
All over the world, people adapted to the pandemic by switching to mobile living, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The industries that achieved the greatest success were those that helped people connect both virtually and in person,” Lexi Sydow, head of market research at App Annie, said in a statement.
The revenue of the mobile games sector reached $90 billion in 2021. The leaders in the number of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, which have little or no plot and minimal video design.
The top 3 most popular games in the world included Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the leading games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
App Annie previously presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends for the next year, the company's analysts named the growth of the number of TikTok users to 1.5 billion, the growing popularity of financial applications among Generation Z, such as the Robinhood application for investors, as well as the further increase in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warned about new scam scheme
Attackers have begun to look for new maneuvers to commit fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes about this with reference to experts.
According to Ivideon Product Director Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communications is deepfakes.
In this case, scammers create a fake video based on real recordings of the victim.
Thanks to this, the neural network is able to accurately reproduce the behavioral characteristics of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using a deepfake, attackers can call the victim’s acquaintances via video or create a video featuring a copy of the person to send out for the purpose of blackmail.
“Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, since a savvy attacker can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Leading system engineer at Varonis Alexander Vetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He emphasized that this could create specific risks when it comes to video technologies.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow wearing a lot of makeup and walking in short skirts, showing stockings and tights on legs.
This is a province, but there WAS such a product in the store.
In big cities, Muslim women wore makeup and showed their thighs.
That’s how it is in Dushanbe, it’s a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are many fashionistas, but not the same cosmetics.
Here are five things you can do to help avoid diabetes
Blood sugar problems are among the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes can lead to severe complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
So, doctors recommend changing your drinking regime - reducing the number of different drinks and switching to plain water has a positive effect on metabolism.
Sugary foods raise blood sugar levels dangerously when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
The onset of the disease is influenced not only by poor diet, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise sticking to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help you lose weight, but will also protect you from sudden fluctuations in sugar levels.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Dietary fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to a feeling of fullness, the secretion of digestive juices and increased absorption of food.

Doctor Pavlova spoke about “weekend migraines” in workaholics
Several factors can lead to deterioration of well-being on weekends.
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after everyday work is often a “weekend migraine,” said the famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine Zukhra Pavlova in her telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics who suffer from this especially often suffer from headaches, fatigue and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated over the week, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the body’s negative reaction to changing conditions.
On weekends our lives change radically.
“We sleep for a long time, lie on the couch all day, most likely we eat more and drink less,” the doctor argued. “Because of the lack of coffee, a slight withdrawal begins.
Due to overeating and lack of water - heaviness and weakness."
Getting up late plays an additional role.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, a reaction called jet lag will occur.
It occurs among travelers who cross multiple time zones.
To determine which factor plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended monitoring what changes most strongly on weekends.

South African scientists report low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against Omicron
South Africa announced the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against Omicron
Scientists from the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
This (omicron neutralization level) is estimated to correspond to a vaccine efficacy of 22.5% against symptomatic infection, which... calls into question the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, the study said, published on MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from severe disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of coronavirus could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in common foods?
Sugar is not the best source of beneficial nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular diseases and cancer.
Consumers should be aware that hidden sugar may be indicated under an unfamiliar word in the product - an ingredient similar to sugar in calorie content, composition and glycemic index.
The label may contain several dozen names that essentially indicate sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently occurring names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, doctor’s sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskoshestvo, the most effective way to reduce your sugar intake is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, and pay attention to the label and the many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter what the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
Calculating the exact amount of sugar is not easy, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Therefore, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than what is stated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues its transition to decarbonizing the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate neutral country.
“That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role,” the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany remains committed to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as this resource is currently important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement documenting Berlin’s support for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Bärbock said that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline continues.
According to the minister, as part of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also indicated that the pipeline does not yet “comply with the requirements” of the European Union.
Thanks for the interesting photos!

Hackers hacked Indian Prime Minister's Twitter
Hackers hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India allegedly recognized Bitcoin as legal tender, and that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.
Modi's office asked him to ignore the new reports.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter responded quickly and access to the account was restored.
The Indian Prime Minister’s page was already hacked in 2020 and calls were made to make donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
Majority voted against independence in New Caledonia referendum
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted against the independence of their territory during the referendum.
However, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755 people) voted in favor of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%; in total, more than 80 thousand residents of New Caledonia took part in the elections.
As Agence France-Presse commented on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt,” as supporters of independence called on voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and “fair” election campaign.
This non-participation thus paved the way for a third victory for the supporters of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists said they do not recognize the results of the latest vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is scheduled to speak on the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has largely animated the final weeks of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have spoken out in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of European Union presence in the Pacific."
“New Caledonia must remain French,” Eric Zemmour has repeatedly repeated.
A similar statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecresse, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October calling on Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed his “strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians should be the choice of France.”
Sveta, oh, hello!
I was a little... a lot rude to you, it’s still awkward and embarrassing.
Thank you for not turning away from my channel.

Just don’t forget that the food was NATURAL, so obesity was not as widespread as it is now.
But medicine was at zero - leeches, garlic and decoctions.
Now we would be back on our feet in no time.

WSJ readers criticized an article about relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and made a number of offensive remarks about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
At the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to “present a united front against Russia.”
WSJ readers expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
“There is quite a lot of false information in this article,” RIA Novosti quotes one reader as commenting.
“Europe is not ours to “lose,” and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never enter into a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine,” another said.

An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril Island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The outbreak lay at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will begin producing new generation jet drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant they will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type.
Alexey Arestovich, a freelance adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president, announced this on December 11.
That is, they are capable of operating against air targets and other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: body and the like,” Dialog.ua quotes him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about jet, not piston-powered UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceed it “in all characteristics.”
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in collaboration with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the joint forces in the Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that the country had begun construction of a plant for the production of modern military drones.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the Bayraktar Savunma company and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense entered into an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kyiv region, which will conduct personnel training, as well as testing and servicing Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader’s office called this memorandum “a big real step forward.”
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions have escaped at Singapore's Changi Airport.
This was reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were going.
One of the escaped lions lay down on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from him because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after employees of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which manages all Singapore zoos, arrived at the airport.
They immobilized the lions using tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and was walking around the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, no people were harmed.
Experts warn of cancer risk due to vitamin B9
Research suggests that excess vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned about this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid have a lower risk of developing certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
University of Alabama at Birmingham professor and nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises monitoring the amount of folic acid consumed throughout the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if you deviate significantly from this figure, up or down.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 tablets unless advised by a doctor, be sure to monitor your dosage, and avoid cereals with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is found, among other things, in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, about 75 thousand people may die due to the omicron strain by April
Forecasts by British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of coronavirus, up to 75 thousand people may die in England in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by The Guardian newspaper with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), TASS reports.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists who are part of the scientific advisory group for emergencies under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022 the country will record at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain, and in total about 175 thousand will be hospitalized. patients.
At the same time, at the peak of the incidence, hospitals will receive more than 2 thousand infected people daily.
"Serious coronavirus measures may be needed to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed if the omicron strain is found to be more infectious than the delta variant and current vaccines fail to eliminate infections," said mathematician Roseanne Barnard from LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency informed: if the spread of the omicron strain remains at its current level, about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
Moreover, by mid-December the Omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
Currently, 1,898 cases of infection with the omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK, of which 633 were detected in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure could already reach 10 thousand cases.
I wanted to write some smart comment, but I read to this point:

Demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter worldwide
Superyacht construction this year and orders for next year are breaking global records, despite calls to reduce its carbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world registry of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of climate change efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress costing £50 million or more will not decrease, writes The Guardian.
However, there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has not been such a rush in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to coronavirus.
If previously all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely and conduct negotiations via Zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if only their yacht would be ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super-rich could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of hardship, traveling into space, living on yachts or flying their own planes causes irritation in society because the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and propose introducing new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, although they understand that with such mobility of money, this will be extremely difficult to implement.
Meanwhile, only the number of superyachts ordered is impressive, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a stern length greater than 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building the 183-meter-long yacht REV Ocean.
Once launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a “lunar pool”, as well as a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, helicopter pads, open-air cinemas have become commonplace, and on some of them, such as the yacht of wrestler McGregor, a platform for martial arts. Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at the American University at Indiana, says that compared with The overall amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by the super-rich is negligible.
But it has a symbolic meaning, considering that there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than that of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission trail landed on his yacht Eclipse, 162.5 meters long.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don't earn the sympathy of others when they, like Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no berth for their giant vessels.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of bowel cancer has been determined
American scientists have determined how much alcoholic drinks per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
The Daily Express writes about this.
Experts have concluded that drinking four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
Moreover, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, men who drink moderately have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact reason for the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a process detrimental to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they have no idea how advanced four-legged pets really are.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligent animals are.
Although a dog's vocabulary is not as extensive as a human's, a new study shows that a dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' works were published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or write poetry, they know nothing about politics, economics and art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts say, show better results in understanding words of the human language, but there is not enough statistical data for accurate conclusions yet.
Thus, some breeds are traditionally considered canine geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and have the same learning ability as a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing for a trade between the US and Russia
The United States and Russia will “bargain” over Ukraine’s entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the Glavred publication.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations in the near future regarding the United States’ guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to “join anywhere.”
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the offeror.
And with regard to Ukraine, bargaining is planned,” the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but strives for dialogue with Kiev.
“The training is carried out secretly, quickly and immediately proceeds to offensive actions, and does not wait until the group is discovered and counteracting forces are deployed,” he noted.
China boosts development of rail transport industry
China's advanced technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition in Zhuzhou City, Central China's Hunan Province.
Core technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd., allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said company spokesman Hou Zhaowen.
High-speed trains operating on the China-Laos railway line, which went into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure improved reliability and serviceability of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its rail vehicle exports and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first double-decker high-speed electric trains designed for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, trial operation of a metro train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will travel along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city airport.
This metro line will open to traffic next year.
This will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness," said Feng Yaoxiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China International Trade Promotion Committee (CICIPD).
“This industry constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-end equipment manufacturing in the global market,” said Feng Yaoxiang.
After more than 60 years of hard work and a series of independent research and development, China has established an advanced railway equipment manufacturing system, with a complete set of supporting facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxiang, the country ranks first in terms of railway electrification and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheikin, in a conversation with Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia may include forgetfulness, as well as a number of mild cognitive impairments, such as an inability to concentrate, plan, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
There is currently a debate that hearing loss may be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheikin emphasized that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebral atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to begin its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity and regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense use of memory and logical thinking.
“There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still debated in the scientific community,” Golosheikin said.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logical thinking,” Golosheikin said.
Earlier, the UK dementia research charity said the disease was increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
Doctors have called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first warning sign can be considered problems with vision, due to which the patient has difficulty recognizing objects.
Experts named aphasia as another sign of developing dementia - a condition when a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
The neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-nervous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is a member of the council of doctors created under the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, and variability of character,” the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the regulatory framework and now the ex-president must be sent for special rehabilitation.
“We call this neurorehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, the possibility of which we have not found in Georgia,” Toidze noted, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage his receipt of medical care after prison service officers subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to cancel the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

These people are parasites on the body of society.
They don’t work, don’t pay taxes, live on benefits and at the expense of their relatives.
At the same time, they receive full medical care.
How many mouths can a working person feed?
We feed all the drunks and drug addicts who have also lost their health due to their stupidity.
Then we are surprised at the extension of the retirement age.
These amounts could be spent on treating really sick people.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests took place against a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate, Europa Press reports.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory to enter bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife venues.
Many demonstrators came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in this city declared a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, and over 88 thousand patients have died.
Russia also plans to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people.
The government introduced bills on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of public events, cultural institutions, public catering and retail establishments with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or past illness, or a medical exemption from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel by train and plane.

Steep climb: how the Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will help raise the 1 trillion yuan earmarked by President Xi Jinping, but will also contribute to the economic development of backward, remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the Winter Olympics site, is becoming increasingly popular among the Chinese.
In addition to building infrastructure, landscaping work is also being carried out in the region: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday at Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still a long way off.
Games adviser Justin Downes says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year more and more Chinese take to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many more years to establish a ski culture here, Downs said.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to be actively developed and the infrastructure necessary for recreation needs to be created there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chongli, close to the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chongli, and now none of the local residents suffer from unemployment.
More and more stores selling clothing and equipment for winter sports are opening across the country.
Catering points serving national cuisine are opening on the slopes.
There is now even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiwu.
China is committed to creating a thriving winter sports industry, with its athletes leading the way in major international competitions and its resorts and facilities becoming world-class.
More than 500 million people in the world could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO said
More than 500 million people in the world could be pushed into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has stalled humanity's progress towards universal access to health care, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the International Day of Universal Health Coverage on December 12, WHO and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to disruptions in the provision of medical services and caused excessive stress in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, and mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and the World Bank emphasized that the pandemic has caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it more difficult for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic had plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people having virtually no social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister was cut off from broadcast at the "Summit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
Taiwan's Digital Minister Audrey Tang's speech at a panel discussion during the US-sponsored Summit for Democracy was switched to video-free mode, according to a recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map Ms Tan was showing was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries around the world according to their degree of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as “free”, and China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were highlighted in red as “closed”.
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the opinions of the panelists "do not necessarily represent the position of the US government."
The PRC was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister could run counter to the “one China” policy followed by Washington.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
Organized by Washington, the "Summit for Democracy" was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an “anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge.”

The New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight
Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight on Saturday, December 11.
The journey, broadcast on the company's website, lasted a total of more than ten minutes, after which the capsule with passengers descended to Earth, TASS reports.
The launch of the launch vehicle was carried out from the cosmodrome near the American city of Van Horn (Texas).
The ship rose to a height of just over 100 km, and the space tourists found themselves in a state of weightlessness.
The launch vehicle itself landed normally at the cosmodrome site.
On July 20, Blue Origin successfully completed the first suborbital flight of the New Shepard spacecraft with passengers on board.

Don’t lump them together - there are bad people, you may have complaints against them for a specific reason...
but what does the number of children, age, pension fund, etc. have to do with it?
Write that they are “scoundrels, they didn’t return the money.”
But how many children they have and when they have is none of your business until they are ready to hang these children around your neck.
And since this is excluded, what right do you have to condemn them?
Perhaps this is only true in education...
Parents chosen (by themselves) dictate their own rules, openly not caring about the existing ones.
What if this applies to other areas of life, legal proceedings, etc.?
There are no laws written for them.
What if dad nevertheless introduces his own methods of upbringing and education?
It’s kind of creepy and a very bad example for others.

China strengthens COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control in cities where land checkpoints are located
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular ordering to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land checkpoints are located, in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the designated cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result obtained within 48 hours before departure.
Those traveling to cities with land crossings must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the specified cities until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land crossing points that meet certain conditions may consider establishing buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Foreign Ministry spoke about the “sad conclusion” in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with Izvestia, assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospects for improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion based on the long journey that we have traveled with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday,” the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are associated with the US desire to impose approaches on Russia on many issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk making optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress has been observed.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security issues and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to common sense arguments.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with American Secretary of State Antony Blinken, said that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the United States.
A virologist warned about the dangers of vaccination with a nasal drug against COVID outside of hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may develop allergies and need medical help, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized at airports and shopping centers.
This was reported to TASS by virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology at Novosibirsk State University Sergei Netesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccine vaccination points at airports and shopping centers, but at first I would do this only in medical institutions.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is advisable for the person to sit next to the doctor’s office after this.
Doctors have special sets of antiallergic drugs that act in literally a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary,” Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in using the drug has been accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated with nasal congestion blows his nose after injection.

Serbia has produced 2 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine
The Sputnik V vaccine is most popular in Serbia.
Serbia has produced about 2 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, the country's Minister of Innovation and Technological Development Nenad Popovic told TASS.
“The state institute Torlak has so far produced about 2 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine; we expect that at least 4 million will be produced in the coming period,” Popovic stated.
According to him, the Russian vaccine is most popular among Serbs.
In this regard, the republic plans to purchase an additional million doses of the vaccine from Russia.
The Minister of Innovation and Technological Development of Serbia also expressed interest in the production of the Sputnik V nasal vaccine and the Sputnik Light drug on the territory of the state.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said that the Russian Federation has supplied almost two million doses of the domestic Sputnik V vaccine against coronavirus infection to Serbia.
Lama, they say true believers make up the church.
Whether these true believers exist or not, we cannot know.

In the UK, 1239 cases of the omicron strain of coronavirus were recorded per day - Teller Report Teller Report
Over the past 24 hours, 1,239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK.
Sky News reports this.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of the Omicron strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new type of infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137 people.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in a pessimistic forecast, calculated that 75 thousand people could die in England by April due to an outbreak of coronavirus caused by the Omicron strain.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions if “aggressive actions” against Ukraine continue, including due to the alleged “invasion” of the country’s territory.
“It is impossible to introduce any restrictions against Russia and not experience suffering yourself,” said a Kremlin official representative on the Rossiya 1 TV channel.
Peskov claims that “everyone in the world understands” this.
It was previously reported that the United States is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank German Gref is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonians reject the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to secede from France.
The French TV channel BFM.TV reported this on December 12.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of residents of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of ballots were annulled.
The level of voting participation that day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago's residents went to the polling stations.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by calls from separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
The majority of residents supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20 thousand kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270 thousand people live on the archipelago; the territory is endowed with a special administrative-territorial status.
There is a 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian administration, according to which the region can organize a vote on its independence twice, two years apart.

WHO tentatively considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) tentatively believes that Omicron is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines against the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information as of December 9, Omicron is registered in 63 countries.
“Preliminary data and the significantly altered antigenic protein profile of the Omicron strain suggest reduced vaccine effectiveness against infection and variant transmission.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it (the “severity of the disease” - ed.) may be less severe than with “delta,” says the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that so far all registered cases of omicron infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than "delta".
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been reported in Russia.
They “were previously immunized,” the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova stated that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of coronavirus is less dangerous than others.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for Zelensky were named
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state may be left without Western support, and may also make compromises on Donbass.
Denisenko spoke about this on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called the “perfect storm,” assumes that key Western countries will stop supporting Ukraine, having reached an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kyiv may face in 2023.
“In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and confrontation between the authorities and key financial-industrial groups (financial-industrial groups. - Ed.),” the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - “a war against everyone.”
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the Ukrainian leadership may make compromises on Donbass, which could result in confrontation within the country.
At the end of summer, Zelensky’s position will weaken; the probability of such a situation, according to the former people’s deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between population groups that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which is why the seizure of control over the security bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives” are likely.
During this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin “reformatting power,” Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the “father of the nation.”
This can be caused by some event that will be a strong shock to society.
“The event must be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine,” Denisenko said.
This scenario for the development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has more than once rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, survey data from the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to record lows, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the country’s ex-president Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, among all respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

Thanks to the author for the story about the great athlete, I didn’t know that Elena Shushunova died, it’s very upsetting to find out.
I remember how I was rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul; for us, residents of the Primorsky Territory, it was a live broadcast, in real time.
Such intensity of passions, emotions went off scale, I remember the joy when Elena won.
We also rejoiced at the other victories, just as we cheered for Salnikov, for the football players, for all the Soviet athletes at that time.
I once saw a documentary on TV about one of the Central American countries, and there they rolled watermelons along the ladder onto the side of the ship like barrels.
The watermelons were monstrous in size.
In my youth, I myself worked many times harvesting and loading watermelons in the Astrakhan region and never saw watermelons weighing more than a pound.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg directly from the melon plant and not earlier than the beginning of August.
Balconette bra with soft lace cups (size: 90E, color beige, composition: 90% polyamide, 10% elastane, article number: 12008).
Balconette bra with soft lace cups, on frames.
The lower part of the cup is reinforced with a non-elastic transparent fabric.
The lateral inner part of the cup, in the area where the straps are sewn, is reinforced with non-elastic fabric in the fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that allows the lace not to stretch.
The richness of the lace can be appreciated thanks to the scallop along the neckline and under the bust.
Vertical boning on the single-layer microfiber side panels prevents the fabric from curling on larger sizes.
I really didn’t like the article, it was evil and poisonous.

A poet arrested for an action on Red Square: “They give you 10 days for quoting Yevtushenko, that’s the power of poetry!”
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which was written the hashtag #poetofrussiamorethanpoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
A protocol was drawn up against Alexander under an administrative article for repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public rally.
The first time he was detained was on January 23 on Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The goal was to attract attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, has been lost, due to the decline of the general culture in Russia, and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag,” explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and reveal the message of his message in more detail.
How did the police officers treat you this time and before during your arrest?
What did they ask in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time the employees were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, no matter how funny it may sound in some context of this word.
On Pushkinskaya they were taken by riot police and taken harshly.
They asked the standard question about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
With the exception of the monkey bar being blown on all 4 sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was getting into.
And if after the action, at least a few people start writing their poems under this hashtag, I will not have spent these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak in private at least in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events they speak the language of others, so that everyone understands what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
This is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks excellent Russian and nevertheless resorts to the help of a translator.
And at official events, transcripts are taken the old fashioned way with a fountain pen, and the stenographer is not required to know several languages.
If you don't want to say a lot, just say no!

Researchers reveal how potatoes help fight age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and microelements, which help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body's systems function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to its high fiber content, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to stew or boil the root vegetable rather than fry it in oil.
The Daily Express previously warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, like other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are foods that contain carbohydrates that are quickly broken down into sugars, such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production on private farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the current shortage of products can only be replaced by imports.

In 2015, copyright holders from the RAEK/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate sites on the Runet and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, general director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks, among other things, to regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series “The Squid Game” and “Tenderness” directed by Anna Melikyan - an original series of the largest video service in Russia ivi (part of the AIV ).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engine results, you can watch the new animated film "Encanto", but, judging by the quality of the video, this is a so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in a cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series “Univer. 10 years later” by the TNT channel (part of Gazprom Media) is available.
Svetlana M., I’m sorry, of course, but I wouldn’t care whether my son is offended by his mother or not.
If we have some kind of misunderstanding going on, it’s better not to get in the way of the estimate at all.
It's good, of course, that this rarely happens.
Bra with soft cups without frames and front clasp, coffee 135I GI1265.
The T-shaped back is reinforced on the inside with crossed cotton and lycra elastic bands.
The bra is made of microfiber combined with mesh fabric for breathability.
Cups are lined with cotton fabric for a comfortable fit.
Unique Magiclift design (crossing support panels under the bust and along the neckline) to lift, separate and support the bust.
Wide, comfortable, microfleece-lined straps are adjustable at the back.
Lyudmila, China now has advanced space technology.
Russia is already hopelessly behind.
“This idea developed by the Poles” - it would be more accurate to say that Poland only reworked the idea of 1776 for itself, but developed it quite effectively.
Actually, the slogan “Outskirts is not Russia” appeared in 1848.
Which, in general, doesn’t really change the essence.
I watched her interview, the girl said that her biggest dream is for her to grow wings, her dad constantly pulls her back.
Well, all this is very doubtful.
Well, I entered the university, what next?
Wall lamp Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
A wide circle framed by “molecules” of light provides the most uniform and bright illumination of the space.
“Atomic” or “molecular” design, reflecting the nature and natural essence of each item, does not lose its relevance and allows you to advantageously place accents in the interior.
One of the characteristic features of such lamps is their weightless design.
Due to thin, almost invisible cables that are adjustable in height, you get the feeling that the chandelier is floating in the air.
Metal gold fittings and matte white miniature lampshades will easily complement any palette, and the pendant chandelier and sconces presented in the collection will become a ready-made ensemble for lighting a living room, bedroom, or hallway.
Well, it depends on the taste and color, as they say.
I really liked Tarragon, not the current one, of course.
The juices poured out of tall glass cylinders were very tasty.
Three servings of syrup is too much for my taste.
Two were just right.
Mattress Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient because it has two surfaces of different softness - high hardness and slightly more than average.
The product contains only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: a block of independent springs “micropack” is installed in the center of the model.
This means that there are 2000 spirals per bed, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides a unique point adjustment.
“Micropacket” is the highest frequency of the entire variety of Dimax spring blocks, therefore it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: combinations of layers of coir and natural latex are installed above and below the springs.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has latex, then the other has coconut coir.
This tandem of fillers has long had the status of a classic, since it imparts to the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
While coir provides proper back support, latex adapts the surface to the human body.
Case: The model comes in a quilted Aloe Vera knit case.
At the request of the client, it can be made either removable or stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.
Warranty and safety: warranty period – 3 years.
The mattress has received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress is CertiPUR certified.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions, launching in five years, is to assess the habitability of Venus's clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed instruments to measure the acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, were too acidic to support life, but Venus was probably originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Let's assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to earthly life or different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that earthly life did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life originated on Earth,” said Mihkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.
It's a hat, not a phone...
Six months for him, and the whole price...
I'm tired of this Chinese nonsense...
They can't make a quality phone...
Whatever, my Samsung has already survived three of these (friends have already thrown them out) and will survive again!
Metaverses will change Russian business
The topic of metaverses became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as throughout the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend to create remote interactions during a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, this is a consequence of the desire of businesses to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
Thirdly, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money go into digital format.
Anya, you are right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you no longer want something too fatty and unhealthy.
Of course, for the holiday we will have both traditional Olivier and herring under a fur coat, but no one is forcing me to gorge myself on everything at once.
You can eat a spoonful, try it, and that’s enough.
After all, there really are ten days off ahead, you can prepare any tasty and healthy dishes.
And how much hellish work, time, and money it took her to train.
And having completed 5 quarter jumps, she was left without gold.
And she also understands that she will not survive 4 years until the next Olympics, i.e. she will never be an Olympic champion.
And those who did not just play sports or cannot imagine all the circles of hell that she went through, DO NOT JUDGMENT.
British economist could not give forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill was unable to give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will fail.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change its course.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in second place is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he does not know whether the increase in commodity prices is temporary or not.
As the specialist pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that “the world of endless generosity of central banks has already outlived its usefulness” and it is time to return to a relationship where inflation-adjusted interest rates will correlate with expected GDP growth rates.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as rising poverty levels and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the global research department at Otkritie Investments, said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, but the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar exchange rate, Shulgin named the Fed’s monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is good: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
There is progress, just sluggish.
There is also this problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people do not know about them.
All sorts of eco-taxi that pick up waste from home.
Yes, it’s a banal collection point for recyclables - it’s used by marginalized people.
Rarely does anyone bring glass and metal there.
Well, the author...
Sausages "with cat meat" in Soviet factories?
"Low" chocolate in the USSR?
Well, yes, they are not tasty enough compared to Doshirak, I understand...
And now I would like to make some Soviet sweets with white filling.
There are no such people anymore.
They don't release "Pilot", but "Romashka" is not at all the same...

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
At the end of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) agency.
To understand the scale, approximately the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia is the leader in terms of revenue in the Russian market.
Over the 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
For Kia's sister brand Hyundai, the increase is even more significant - more than 35%, and revenue from car sales is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
This brand also holds a leading position in terms of increasing the weighted average price of a car - over the year for Hyundai it increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz had a stronger increase in price.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands did not grow so significantly: according to statistics from the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars over the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - by almost 12%.
Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand increased both sales volume (by 37%) and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles ).
“Mercedes-Benz is simultaneously experiencing good growth in sales and weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence the greater growth in financial capacity,” explained NAPI General Director Tatyana Arabadzhi.
In terms of sales growth rates, Chinese brands are showing fantastic results, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.”
The Russian Lada demonstrates average market indicators in terms of income growth (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand over 10 months.
At the level of last year in terms of financial capacity, there are companies whose car sales in units fell in 2021: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is completely in the red - in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of auto components and interruptions in production that have affected the entire global auto industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same AvtoVAZ increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last increase in price (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end November.
Other automakers regularly rewrite the price tags for their products.
The volume of the Russian automobile market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation is contributing to this, as well as the desire of automakers to win back past losses, experts say.
In conditions of a shortage of cars, I think that many automakers were even able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of previous periods, which they could not include in the price of cars earlier,
says VTB Capital auto industry analyst Vladimir Bespalov. -
I believe that financially, automakers are doing very well right now, maintaining high sales margins."
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021; prices for new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the increasing complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
As supply increases, the scope for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to earn their income through volumes, notes independent automotive industry consultant Sergei Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, automakers are now striving to make the greatest profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev. -
An increase in car production volumes is not expected for at least the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also fueled by citizens’ uncertainty about the future.
Against the backdrop of the current market situation, cars turned out to be a good investment object - a car bought a year ago, even with mileage, can now be sold for more than its original cost, the expert states.
Biden spoke about the transfer of US troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending US troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian “invasion”.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
“There have never been such plans,” the head of the White House said, answering a journalist’s question about whether the United States had abandoned such an idea.
Biden noted that if the situation around Ukraine escalates, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries to which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intentions of invading the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in Kiev’s combat use of Turkish-supplied drones, as well as in the fact that “American weapons are approaching our territory.”
I immediately leave such interviews.
If already at an interview they want to force me to listen to screams, wait for hours, drink an incomprehensible drink and wash another cup - I can’t imagine what will happen at work.
I’ll find a normal place for myself, without the HR layer, where you can immediately talk to the manager.
Mattress Promtex-Orient Monolit Combi 16 100x185 cm

Two types of filler.
The sandwich model consists of eight layers of fillers.
Thin slabs of coconut coir are laid between the latex slabs.
The layered structure of the mattress is characterized by increased wear resistance, durability and resistance to stress.

Versatility and orthopedic support.
The mattress is suitable for people of different body types and ages.

The mattress is ideal for both one person and a married couple.
The latter will especially appreciate the presence of a stable surface and the absence of a “wave” effect, when vibrations on one side of the mattress can be transmitted to the opposite, disturbing a person during sleep.

If a scammer calls from such a number, it seems like an “employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs” or another law enforcement agency, then it is ineffective to reset immediately, and most likely there will not be time to blacklist it.
Because to confirm his lie about his involvement in the security forces, he quickly repeats the call and continues to frighten and persuade.
We need more useful recommendations for the people.
This is such nonsense...
I don’t believe at all that it happened like that.
They no longer know what to come up with, who to blame.
We reached the Queen.
And most importantly, in their opinion, everyone is to blame except the very best...
Wouldn’t it be easier to leave people alone from coercion, of course, if our people care about their people.
Maybe all strains of the virus will disappear...
Like in Japan... before the elections they weakened their influence and there were fewer infections...
Set of wool for felting "Assorted No. 2" 100% merino, wool 4x10 g.

Maria Kartashova, what does “in response to this” mean?
I don’t voice my thoughts, I mentally curse you all.
I mentally chop off the heads of everyone who did not give up their seat to me, mentally send them into a ditch and burn all the cars that interfere with my passage, mentally everything!
And in appearance I can even smile at you.
But I remember that thought is material!
Peter, Nicholas II did not sign a single death sentence during the years of his reign.
Even such lawless people as Koba and his team.
And Bloody Sunday is already an invention of the Bolsheviks.

The film by student Alexander Sokurov received a European Oscar for best editing
The Russian film Unclenching Fists, nominated for an Oscar, received the European Film Academy award (also called the European Oscar) in the Best Editing category, Moskovsky Komsomolets reports.
The competition jury, who voted online due to the difficult epidemiological situation, appreciated the outstanding skill of the film’s creators.
This time the film by Jasmila Zbanic (Bosnia) “Where are you going, Aida?” received the maximum number of awards.
The main character of the film is a translator for a UN mission who is trying to save her family during the war in Yugoslavia.
As for the drama “Unclenching Your Fists,” directed by Kira Kovalenko (a graduate of Alexander Sokurov’s workshop), this film tells about the complex relationship between an overbearing father and his growing children in North Ossetia who want to free themselves from their father’s care.
It was previously announced that the film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film.
As regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey show, in my opinion, you are, to put it mildly, out of touch.
Just yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of a joint Azerbaijani-Russian KamAZ enterprise.
