The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a #PRS_ORG# big customer, so it's no problem for me.
Just need a number or instruction of what I should put on the package so it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and re-order for the better price, or is there another way to get a credit?
I also fundamentally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Look for a while, help for a while, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help out in the family and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I see no problem with that.
If your K1 is left alone for a short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You're best placed to judge whether this is right for your children.
It’s not as if he’s supposed to wrap K2 in a blanket and rock him to sleep for hours.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is where the psychologist’s statement comes from.
Because if something should actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can't remember the title no matter what. Maybe someone here knows something...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself in food and going into the enclosure of his big cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, gets to his therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxious patients.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the place of the suicide and document it and put the photos on the internet.
Anyway, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients end up facing their fear in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of a window, another deliberately drives herself to death)
This confronting of the fear is called "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there's a big showdown at the hospital where the fire started.
That's the gist of it. I'm pretty sure the original book was written by a French author.
If this action is known to anyone or if someone could even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the Wi-Fi password.
I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take time.
What steps do I need to take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 yr, Splinter under thumb nail
Child, four years old, has wood splinters under the thumb nail (outside) for the entire length.
Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
Did not work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chances.
Tomorrow I’m going to the doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote booster vaccinations
New omicron cases are causing concern for politicians and scientists in the UK.
By New Year, all eligible adults in England should be offered a vaccine.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make faster progress with the Corona booster vaccinations in the face of rapidly increasing Omicron numbers than has been the case so far.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens.
Until now, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will additionally provide support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In the face of the omicron variant, there is an emergency, which is why vaccination protection must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose.
"Get boosted now!" Johnson said.
Another 1,239 cases of the Omicron variant were recorded in the UK on Sunday, bringing the total to 3,137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm all for pronouns
I have sent an application.
Today, the invitation to a meeting came by email.
I want to respond to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter" but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
* * I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
** I am a foreigner and I don’t want to step on the toes of officials either.
Conclusion: Everyone should get acquainted with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work
Apparently, the chair had an unseen flaw when it was sold.
How can such a upholstery damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Will try #PRS_ORG# first.
But this has been working for about
14 days no more.
So I've always bought the last few books through the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#
I've bought 6 #PRS _ ORG # but wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for that.
[CW] The feeling of not being able to help.
Content warning: I'm going to write about domestic violence in some detail here.
I just need to write something from the heart.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims cannot be helped or we think we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are few things in my job that upset me more than not being able to do anything in situations like this.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a one-on-one conversation with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach all of them.
I don ’ t know what the reason is, maybe it ’ s fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of separating the children from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, partly very close to the tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to accept violence.
I often wish I could help in any way... I know I can't.
But it never gets any easier.
Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incomprehensibly important.
'Arcane' on Netflix: What does the series have in common with 'League of Legends'?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a breathtaking setting: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, was recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least for youngster Johannes Patrick, there was no hope.
Again nothing: For the second time within not even three months the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick, looking back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October at the Hakro Merlins in Crailsheim, said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs".
After the game, however, she did not go to bed – instead, she increased her workload in the face of the 61:72 defeat (28:38) in the Basketball Bundesliga.
More than the naked result, it was the manner of the performance that disappointed.
Representative is a statistic that expresses the whole dilemma: The three-pointer rate was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer came from John Patrick: "After the victory in Tenerife, we just weren't concentrated enough, and didn't implement what we had trained".
To move the ball.
His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, reacted quite differently: "To win an exciting game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people."
Only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they got their money’s worth.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Short, who scored 22 points and steered his team to victory.
"The best playmaker I have ever coached," Gleim added.
Meanwhile, Patrick's team's top scorers Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (seven) struggled throughout the lineup.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to within eight points, after they had already been 39:59 behind.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Luckily, there is not much time left for grumbling.
Already on Wednesday (7pm) the giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I signed up a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We sought legal advice again and wrote to them again.
We originally signed up half a year ago.
Always as fresh as a daisy: Max Raabe turns 59
He excites his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
At the moment he is on tour with the programme "Good Day, Dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "by order of the authorities" to contain the Corona virus.
Other of his performances planned for the Advent season will also have to be cancelled, according to the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchestra.de).
From January, the artists want to make up for the dates they had to postpone in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on 12 December 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe sang a lot and enjoyed it as a youngster.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has won many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women This Is No Problem" (2013), the second place in the charts.
He has managed to bring it out of the niche and into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly combed back and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is an integral part of the current German-speaking music scene.
Since 2020, he has been on tour with the program "Good Day, Dear Luck". dpa

It still doesn't work, I can only look at the cover but not turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Housing Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment
The new Federal Minister of Housing, Klara Geywitz of the SPD, has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
‘With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes’, said Geywitz in an interview with the ‘Tagesspiegel’ (Sunday).
My aim is to give tenants peace of mind that their rent will remain affordable in the years to come.
By the way, a colourful mix of private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party will use an expert commission to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not ease, Geywitz is not ruling out talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rental price cap until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets and the expansion of the rental level.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not loosen up, "we will talk with coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I realized that I forgot the last step in the payment.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
A devastating storm system has spawned numerous tornadoes across the US.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths to mourn.
The images from there are reminiscent of a war zone.
In the night to Saturday, several tornadoes caused heavy devastation in the USA and possibly demanded up to a hundred victims.
The storms left a swath of destruction about 200 miles long, especially in the commonwealth of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after visiting the disaster area that "everything is gone" where the tornado touched down.
Houses, shops, government buildings - gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It's hard to imagine how that's even possible.
In the state of Kentucky alone, he reckons that up to a hundred people have died, and the official figures are rising by the hour.
Hello, I just saw that they sold out of the #NAME# display case.
That's a shame.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely out of stock?
Is it possible to order these showcases in another country?
Until when do you have to register?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I order the cover now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or submitted a return and wanted to ask whether it arrived or is being processed, as I have not yet received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses, change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees cash bonuses for getting vaccinated.
They are thus in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination calls – following the German model – is also intended to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
He has moved to a company he used to troll.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
Apparently, he didn’t want to stick with his old job and found something else.
You can do that too.
And that he didn’t like you back then: well, whatever.
He didn’t like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I'm taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the rescue!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends in the adventure Over the Grim Pass and would like to seamlessly integrate my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out and now I am writing the introductory adventure and stumble over my own feet already at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes have to bring a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
That is where the plot will develop.
Some miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the heroes and lure them into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: to convince, to act, to threaten, to recognize the danger at an early stage, whatever the players come up with.
Group size: 8 regular goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabres
When unnoticed, the goblins ambush the heroes in a culvert and flank the wagon with three archers on the left and three on the right, while two stop the wagon with spears.
If it comes to a fight and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are all found unconscious and subsequently healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The wheelbarrow is, of course, gone.
2. If a defeat is unavoidable, it is this half-elf, together with two of his henchmen, who comes to the aid of the hero in battle.
The cart is still there, all good.
How do you feel about the Deus ex Machina of solution 2?
Is the encounter too much of an adventure starter?
The Goblin group will later play a crucial role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
EDIT: wow, I did not expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely be implementing many of your ideas, and I now have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
So I would still like to send them back
Can you then send the receipts to come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to # PRS _ ORG #.

I'm annoyed with Sky Sports F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to take a break with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today in order to start the F1 pre-race coverage on time.
Although the schedule was far behind the planning due to the delayed start and the start accident, you could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!).
Apparently, however, it is the case that for legal reasons F1 has priority and therefore everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still, stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race.
Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was once again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen can change the tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on this subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen.
I think you should just know such elementary rules if you commentate F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first puzzle rated, which is now possible or required by the rules, both have simply constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
In general, I don't like the artificial comment style of Roos, but I have to admit that it's a matter of taste.
But I actually like Heiko Wasser from RTL even better.
Then there are the constant gaffes, which make both of them seem unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "Uuuuu HD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter in particular brings a lot of agitation into the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the final lap Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into the advertising, as you can hear at F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary has to do after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
These two broadcasters also make less advertising in the training than Sky, and that as a free TV broadcaster.
It is true that one has to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sports F1's schedule is similarly barren and repetitive.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster to broadcast F1.
Except for the advertisements, RTL does a better job of covering the four races it is allowed to broadcast.
At any rate, the grandiose F1 season is a lot less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG-pendulum lamp, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The first lady told me that it would be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12 / 12 / 19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the material has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I am asking for support.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplementing an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifts.
This series is offered by us in 3 variants.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performances in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, they can be used to operate entire plants.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. However, fan pumps are also available to add an accent to the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find them in our shop) or with a decoration that transforms the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, a shell, or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected via an air hose 4 / 6 mm to an exhauster or similar...and it can start.
The fan pump should be the same height or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed between them.
Simply cut the air hose and insert the valve in between.
This would prevent if once the water would run backwards, which the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The MK Series pumps are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we here at ebay indicate the processing time with 3 days, it is packed every day and the packages are also picked up here every day.
Everything is going well, it’s going very fast.
We just want to nip this in the bud so no one is upset just because it took a little longer.
It would be like that, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the freight forwarding industry...of course, Corona doesn't stop here.
Please do not rate poorly just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to make fun of these services, even though we're saying right now,...they're having a hell of a time
This is also very different regionally.
Be kind to everyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Do you also order the legs in light?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and anchor into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have made a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The ten-minute flight took off and landed in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos greeted the newly minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
To the applause of friends, family and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers emerged one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they traveled for ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard, after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: spaceflight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She just tagged along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
He would love to return to space, the host said.
"New Shepard" flies as high as 100 kilometers
The New Shepard rocket system is largely automated.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times in weightlessness, before the reusable object landed again with large parachutes.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the limit of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was Blue Origin's third manned test flight: the first, in July, was piloted by Amazon founder Bezos himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second, in October, was attended by 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world-famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in Star Trek, as well as former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and Blue Origin's vice president, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of advancing the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of mankind and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in or studies biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and I actually find the subject quite exciting and I am not bothered by being in the lab (I already did the inorganic chemistry internship).
Of course, I also found out about career prospects before I started studying, but at the time I also thought that I definitely wanted to study until I got my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I am having doubts, and the job prospects are particularly depressing.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) you hear again and again super job opportunities and the profession is totally in demand, on the other hand you hear again and again about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
So I would really like to know:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you happy with your job/salary?
3) What did you study? What kind of education did you have?
4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am really unsure at the moment and am thinking of possibly dropping out of university in 2022 and doing an apprenticeship as a computer scientist.
If you have experiences there, please write about it :)
Extra stress before holidays & weekends
This topic came up for me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to unwind.
That is why it is only now that a post has been put up about it.
Not only before major holidays, such as the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
It seems that there are also holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was Ascension Day, which in Switzerland is called "Auffahrt".
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last weekend was a long 4-day weekend.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
According to e-mails that had to be sent out before the weekend, orders here, orders there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... why?
Because "next week" after so much time sounds like it can't be true?
Or because people want to do as much as possible in a shortened week as they would in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed out on Wednesday, I was also royally pissed off.
What is this self-sacrifice for holidays?
So why do we even have holidays if we can’t properly enjoy them?!
Mind you, the stress didn’t come from above, the colleagues were all very independent about it.
My question is simply: Are we the only ones, the Swiss?
Is this our Reformed-Evangelical way?
Or do you know this in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld, 42, is looking forward to Christmas in her home state of Thuringia – but hasn’t received any presents yet.
"The beautiful thing is, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, you can just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will get into the festive spirit by baking biscuits with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
However, she still has a lot to do until the contemplative days: "For the first time, I still don’t have any gifts, I have to finally get started."
Nekton-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and feather regrowth.
Nekton-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg biotin / kg.
Nekton-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in poultry farming is due exclusively to feeding errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of an impeccable plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and / or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
Nekton-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered via drinking water or via soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately still not working
DDR handmade model Altbau E-Lok E95 03 DRG / DR, the locomotive was used in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the conversion proposal of the model railway builder ME Heft 11 / 1968, used with play tracks and missing parts see photos, function good, The E 95 series is a heavy freight train electric locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft, which was designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the Silesian network, possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we have restored it to working order
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that would be able to transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km / h on this route.
A top speed of 65 km/h was required.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG decided on the delivery of a 1 ’ Co + Co1 ’ locomotive with AEG Tatzlager drive with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckert works with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered, which received the operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All of them survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union as war reparations.
They returned to Germany in November 1952.
All six locomotives were deemed worthy of restoration at the Dessau Imperial Railway Workshops.
[4] With the progressive re-electrification of the Central German network, there was an increasing need for locomotives for the heavy freight train service. In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were refurbished, while the other machines served as spare parts donors.
First, the E 04, the E 44 and the E 94, which were available in larger quantities, were built.
Only when it became clear that the E 94 could not be further upgraded, did the E 95 come into focus for upgrading.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed at the Leipzig-Wahren depot.
They arrived in 1960 at the Halle P depot.
They were mostly used in a separate circulation plan before coal trains from the Geisel Valley in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
With increasing age, the complicated control of the locomotives proved problematic.
As a result, it was not uncommon for shooters to get stuck while performing actions.
Then Beimann, who was constantly travelling on this locomotive, had to use a hammer and chisel to disconnect the guard during the journey.
Damage to the traction motors was common, leading to months of downtime for the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new locomotives available and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at that time, the Reichsbahn was able to dispense with old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so that the E 95 was taken out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn only wanted to operate electric locomotives with a single crew, which would have caused a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility from the cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were taken out of service in mid-1969, the E 95 01 was the last to leave service on 5 October 1970.
The intended new designation 255 000 was therefore never used.
Except for the E 95 02, all locomotives were dismantled.
The E 95 02 was installed as a substitute for the future museum locomotive E 7710 as a point heating plant at the main station of Halle.
It took some time before the responsible people at the Reichsbahn were convinced that the E 95 was worth preserving as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the locomotive was initially externally restored with the aim of being able to present it at a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operational museum locomotive.
In 1986, the locomotive was completed internally.
The locomotive is being looked after in a museum in Halle (Saale).
Since 1995, employees of the Bw Halle P traditional community have been working on the operational restoration of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was able to be presented for the first time at an exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with a new interior and exterior paint, where the transformers were checked and five traction motors are operational.
-The locomotives were used until 1945 on the Silesian Mountain Railway and the branch lines, where they proved their reliability and low maintenance costs.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig for the Central German network.
Initial focus was on Silesia
Handwork model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical repairs on the locomotive in self-employment necessary, dusty, with play tracks, cellar smell!!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition - possibly the construction kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
Packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F parts are it
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam can not be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I can't put the bed together.
The middle beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately faulty produced.
The middle crossbar does not fit into the intended holder.
So I get new ones sent.
When will they be sent?
No, no flat ones.
These are the right ones from the form, they were just too narrow
But that doesn’t matter.
As long as they serve their purpose
Mine are not flat
Could I get these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
House fire with two minor injuries and major damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in an apartment building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated €60,000 worth of damage was caused, the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were taken to hospital on Sunday with minor smoke inhalation, according to reports.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but police did not suspect arson.
The Criminal Investigation Department of Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But that comes much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To counter fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin shared a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn"
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously spoken publicly about his vaccination status.
The entrepreneur has now published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend prompted him to do so, Şahin said.
Mainz-based company Biontech's CEO and co-founder Uğur Şahin has posted a photo showing him getting a coronavirus vaccine.
There was misinformation on social media that I was not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on LinkedIn.
"For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected this, because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a phone call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is battling a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not vaccinated, Şahin continued.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"But the most common cause seems to be fear, often stoked by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is hard to fight with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself made clear.
"At the moment, I am not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany for the vaccination of the vaccine.
In the meantime, the prioritization has long been suspended – and according to his own statements, the Biontech boss has had himself vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating either.
A fire had disabled a substation.
After a fire with serious damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
Due to the fire, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities on Friday evening.
Supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the widespread disruption could finally be completely repaired in the late evening.
Firefighters and THW helpers provided support in the municipalities.
Authorities offered care places in schools and called for help from the community.
The supplier thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire brigades and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology sector, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repairs to the damage will take a few days, as the Westnet installers were only able to reactivate some of the lines provisionally, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity is flowing again
According to information from Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at around 7.15 p.m. severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the substation in Neunkirchen-Seilscheid.
Extensive cleaning and repair work is needed there.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually switched on from 9:30 p.m.
Since 11:15 p.m., those affected by the outage have also been without electricity.
More than 80 installers from Westnetz and partner companies were involved.
After setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, the authorities also called for help from the neighborhood.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and inform the local fire stations if help is needed," said district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
Residents of retirement homes were the main focus when it came to setting up and operating emergency generators.
In addition, according to the authorities, temporary care facilities were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need power-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the #PRS_ORG# daily cover in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount that underneath on the tabletop.
This is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions.
We wanted those with tabletop diameters of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't fit it in and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a feedback
Yes, that's really easy!
Then we’ll do it like this!
Can you send me the return receipt by email?
the repair is now complete.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I hadn't restarted the E- #PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low compliment almost rude.
We don't agree with that
Nordic Combined: Combined skier Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to concede to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber once again, who had already started the cross-country skiing with a large lead after the ski jumping.
Return the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we both made s new and use the version 4.5...
It could be that they have heard about problems before
Bought a book directly from my #PRS_ORG# and it seems to be on it.
When I try to open it, I get the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be corrupt, report to customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG #epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I also have to work in between!
In order for the paint job to be even and clean, you should clean the components with a little soapy water of dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse with clear water and dry.
Before you use the brush for the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of the components, which will no longer be visible, or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the component
Pull the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlapping of the color layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid scrubbing back and forth with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors.
The dark ones might shine through later.
Metallic tones and metallic colours are added at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, they can cause unsightly metallic streaks when mixed with normal paints.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before assembling them.
The models achieve an original and faithful appearance through the decals or stickers.
From insignia on airplanes to ship names to trim and decals on automobile models: The decals give the model the finishing touch.
Bring the decals in the right order while the parts are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be or is easily painted before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers and toothpicks are the time, patience and a steady hand.
Cut out each decal you need individually and lay them out.
Decals are also called water shift images because you briefly wet the back of the decal with water until the transfer paper darkens from the moisture.
Then just slide the image a little bit from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding place on the model (which you also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the transfer paper sideways.
Attention: Always check if the image is sitting correctly before pushing it completely off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Squeeze out excess water with a kitchen towel.
Attention Not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book for a short time, as soon as I look for something else, then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log in and load the book again and look for the place where I read.
On Saturday, I already communicated with you.
Do I get this by email?
Even for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 separate parcels
ok anyway, thank you!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
But will I get it back without problems?
Treatment for infertility at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for a while, and now that it's time to settle with the health insurance, they're suddenly being difficult.
In order:
We had applied for the IVF treatment for children in advance at the PKV and received the approval for 3 attempts.
The experiments were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was excluded from the PKV.
Some time later we tried to get a second child, and made 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these as part of the PKV.
We again requested the PKV to take over the costs and were again granted 3 more attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones with the PKV) we submitted the bills to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The justification: With the pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts of the first promise lapse.
The second child is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, however, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who has the right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to reimburse)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the agreements that with a birth the further attempts would lapse?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts could weigh in here.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best reach them again?
Okay.
We will no longer order from them.
When they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously lost a good customer.
They are welcome to forward it to their manager.
That's not competitive.
Yesterday my colleague told me that the refund was triggered and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back first.
I can't really do anything about the fact that the chest of drawers doesn't work for me
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote
It clearly states that the refund was initiated and I still have not received a refund via #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that you've now lost two regular customers.
My boyfriend also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cupboard and be able to provide it to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional purchasable stools, which we unfortunately cannot find in your area.
Can they help?
Theme of the week: The best low budget films
There is no universal definition of what a low-budget film is, with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has this to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little or no funding from a major studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already set up 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Wanted to know the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much
With kind regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes about the waiting position...I will soon give up again, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
‘Half-victory’ against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can claim a ‘half victory’ in its conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU did not resolve the confrontation in a sustainable way, explained the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This stalemate - Belarus is not quite small, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decide to oppose it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development is weakening cohesion in the Union.
"It can apparently not prevail if a member state gets it into its head to do its thing", as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A basic agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt to cross the border
According to Poland’s Border Guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory via Belarus.
Fifty-five migrants were detained overnight and returned to the border on Sunday, a spokesperson for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants during the incident near the town of Czeremsza.
According to the information, one soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the Border Guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of having lured it with the prospect of EU entry.
Poland and Lithuania closed sections of the border, according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to the countries of origin of people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the scales and proved its resolve to operate with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the security apparatus to regularly smuggle thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Mercedes has lodged an appeal following the controversial Formula One finale in Abu Dhabi.
The Silver Arrows are suspected of breaking two rules in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest relates to an alleged infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last Safety Car phase, when he is said to have overtaken illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and was celebrating his first Formula 1 title.
The move came shortly after the end of a Safety Car period, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I'm checking this.
I'm talking to the bank and I'll get back to you
Thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fantasy Day
The Europa-Park, the namesake of the Europa-Park Stadion of the Sport Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park free of charge on that day.
There were also vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains glowed red and white that day through the jerseys.
Foxes, Ed Euromaus and lots of red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," the park said.
Cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park in Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in Europa-Park, it was once again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing beaming fans having fun on the roller coaster together confirms this," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
why is this €#NUMBER# and not as originally 1699€?

Sorry, but just because he says he’s not an anti-Semite doesn’t mean anything.
It's like when a racist says they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of them will admit it.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some kind of anti-Semitic message.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just leave it completely.
Yes, wow, then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions evolution on a fundamental level is simply lost.
For all I know, a god started it all.
But once you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just a bunch of nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifier should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specially aplanatic-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the magnifier practically without registration and color errors up to the edge zone.
Lenses are often marked with magnification.
However, this information only applies to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
In order to optimally use your magnifier, we ask you to pay attention to the information in the table "Technical Data" (see instructions in the package).
Light reflections are created on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including eyepieces.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflection coating.
If the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifier close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less perceptible.
Further information can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many curious situations when selling fir trees.
On one occasion, a man reportedly drove home without his partner because they could not agree.
Every year he plants around 2,000 of them.
In the process, the 56-year-old has experienced many curious situations.
That always makes the pre-Christmas period a bit more fun, he says.
And that with the voucher?
Otherwise, I’m out as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to debate which is the better court here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both therefore have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which doesn't sound nearly as tasty.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan / Magic
We've had a new fibre optic connection in the house for a couple of weeks now.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit flawlessly, except for a few failures.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and on the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also arrive.
However, on the other DLan module, which emits the Wifi, no longer the full 500 arrive, but the further I am in the house with the module, the less arrives (so use a power outlet that is 1, 2,3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new glass fiber connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\ ~ 45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but also here there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why with glass fiber so much Internet speed is "lost" over the power line?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely expensive to lay cables in the house for a LAN.
I'm really desperate, which is why I've created a special account here.
That is why I would be all the more pleased with an answer.
When it's time to switch your current account
Anyone who thought that there would be a lull in current accounts is disappointed.
While many banks have used the autumn to once again confirm the fee increases of the past with all kinds of tricks from their customers, the free allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now it has halved the free allowance and even quartered the daily wage.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank division of the group – to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for day-to-day accounts.
However, these lower overdraft fees now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still in force, as is the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced overdraft fees in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox, more than 100 banks now have a free allowance of 25,000 euros or less.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have even won in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Banks are now discussing whether the institutions might have to make provisions - in case even the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be inadmissible in principle and many millions of bank customers have to be refunded.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their lives are like a rollercoaster.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, has been named the most powerful woman in entertainment for 2018 by The Hollywood Reporter.
For her, who made a splash in 2021 with the Friends reunion and the continuation of her series The Morning Show, this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
An army of assistants, stylists and trainers look after her appearance.
After all, Aniston said, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, read that correctly: one chip from the bag).
It's a miracle that the hearts of female and male fans alike are drawn to her.
Maybe because they just have bad luck - and are still looking for the great love of their life.
And crossed off the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who ask that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be seen whether success and fame make people happy.
An undignified end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up
Kimi Räikkönen’s farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the tyres, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after not even half the race distance at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motorsport royal class.
His wife Minttu and their two children also travelled to the United Arab Emirates for his farewell.
Raikkonen's biggest success was winning the 2007 world championship with Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix, started 18 times from pole and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins two-man bobsleigh - Sport
The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I've done the maths, I'd have to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
He first defended against Johannes Lochner’s attack on Saturday, in which he went from third to first.
Then he changed something in the material setting and went out on Sunday with a 0.30-second bigger lead.
Together with his teammates Thorsten Margis from SV Halle, Candy Bauer from BSC Oberbärenburg and Alexander Schüller from SV Halle, he beat the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd win in a row.
Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who races for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after being in second place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach came in eighth after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
On her home track, Laura Nolte won her third two-woman bobsleigh victory of the season.
After finishing in fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to victory in the German three-in-a-row with pusher Deborah Levi on Sunday.
Two-woman bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to qualifying for the Olympics, it was her first podium finish of the season.
Wiesbaden native Kim Kalicki came in third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium place in the world cup, I am superhappy that Mariama takes me with her.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and stressed: "It is not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not quite flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the duvet in my shopping basket and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I did not receive it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had time for it.
And now it was said that it had been cancelled, which made me very angry.
Check out the chat about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it has just been reduced :)
Why is shipping only starting on 16 March?
There was no mention of such a long delivery time on your website
No, only when I tap on it, an extra field appears with the message
Was taken by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf unit, a new, unused one
And not cancel the whole order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear wonderful ladies and girls and women,
I have a few things that I just want to write and maybe it's the one or the other...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog does not bark or goes to kindergarten, he is actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, got a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to burns).
On top of that, he is cold and we are seeing less of each other (1-2 times a week) which is very difficult for me in terms of my needs for affection and love.
My dog child just has a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and stroking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's away for a month.
Now we also have to do the housework, which we naturally divide up.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me right now...
My PTSD illness is just very well adjusted, I am halfway well treated and get along.
Not good, but I'm managing and am almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have not done anything yet and the day after tomorrow I have anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more room.
So my week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it’s the weekend.
But then the whole thing continues?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so stressed out right now that I need these mental crutches, otherwise I'm going to fall apart.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same?
Honestly, I'm so grateful I don't have to work.
I can't put into words how truly grateful I am.
I don't know if I would have survived without my kptbs.
I think that also has something to do with mental load of women and that's why I thought I'd find fellow sufferers here...
In any case, I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has impression.
For the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch tables now, will I get a different color, or what?
The email for cancellation was sent on 12.26.#NUMBER#
By the way, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I noticed at school that many religious teachers did not believe in God and for them it was just another subject like math or geography.
For me it was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was brought up as a Christian and I always believed in something.
What do you think?
Maybe you can also tell about work and / or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate them.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But wouldn't it be odd to have a physics teacher who didn't believe in the theory of relativity?
So what makes you want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Preserving culture or something?
Hopefully, the question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? Please write in English, I also understand it well
It's been a long time since I've done that
Yes, thank you.
I expect a reply soon, at the latest at the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
The film has two timelines (or parallel universes).
On the one hand, modernity (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it any better, in the real world there is a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from the Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action is born.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm in order to be able to live, I think.
I believe the crossing is also the burial site of the soldier.
At the end, I think both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that means anything to you, I'm grateful for any response.
Our little one has only slept on her tummy since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive: D
Relax.
Such a child can take a lot more than you think.
Make sure everything is in place, no cuddly toys, go in and check more often but don't sit and watch for minutes.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child sleep.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it be propped up from the abdomen?
Or is it with the face forward directly in the mattress?
From that, you can tell if everything is okay.
We have also all grown up and when my husband was born, it was the norm to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written to one of your colleagues yesterday and so far no reply.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUME-ID#).
The right-hand drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The closet is not currently in use.
To be clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know that not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It’s just that the station’s politics are so bad.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said to be an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: You don’t want to be a running billboard.
What are we now?
An 0815 promoter trying to get his BilloMerch to the Elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's and Don'ts.
Naturally, they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A crook who lacks all empathy and tries to make money at the expense of the exploded rented rooms.
How are you supposed to find all that good?
Great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I am requesting a recall as my delivered wooden table is defective.
Corpus rupture due to damaged #PRS_ORG# delivery.
Whether as a comforter for a stomach ache or just for cuddling – my little warm friend can be used in many ways.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for beneficial heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it again in doses.
The removable interior cushion can be easily warmed in the microwave or oven.
The soft texture makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cherry kernel pillow with reference is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following areas of application:
Before warming up the kiss on untypical smell, stain or burn mark check and if present immediately dispose of.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before heating!
Warm in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back in place.
During the first heating, a slight moisture may form on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Be sure to adhere to the indicated heating instructions, as prolonged periods or higher energy performance can lead to damage (fire and combustion hazard!).
Before warming up the kiss in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the user manual of the manufacturer.
After the warmed inner pillow has been put back in place, please check the temperature of the kiss on suitability for babies (max. 43 ° C) on your elbow!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, hemorrhages and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain sensitivity.
In case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumour diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose kernels escape, dispose of the product and loose kernels immediately and inaccessibly to children.
If the product is applied to babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during application to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is located.
The fabric is removable and machine washable at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the cellar.
Things are not going well for Ingolstadt under their third coach either.

Is the battery dead?
Yesterday evening my laptop (ThinkPad E470 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply.
I bought this new about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the charger alone would be enough for operation.
False display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply being plugged in.
I then expanded the battery, but again, nothing happened.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network mode?
Is anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like to have the #PRS_ORG# delivered to my room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
With a capacity of 20 litres, larger photo equipment can also be swallowed without problems, which can be stored safely with the help of the padded FlexFold divider.
And everything else you need for everyday use is well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design is literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing instant access to photo equipment.
This can be done in two ways: conventionally via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an exceptionally well thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven its worth with the Messenger Bags.
The closure flap contains a metal latch with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of different “fill levels ”: there are actually 4 anchor bars, firmly welded, into which the closure hooks can be hammered.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a deeper one.
The flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
So the backpack can also be closed reliably without straining the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from the top - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday suitability of the backpack enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more about this below) and thus store both of them easily separated from each other - and also access them independently via the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side to the front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things stay safely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, easily adjustable shoulder straps help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents will remain dry even if you are going to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commission of the
Contact was made by the shipping company to collect the incorrectly delivered table.

I request immediate settlement.
I am already writing to the third support employee, with none of them I got further than the promise that I would get an email as confirmation.

When can we expect the wardrobe to be delivered again?
Keeping him like this is not an option for me...
It works.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the item be delivered?
The order was placed and paid for on 12 January 2021.
I was sent a completely different lamp to the one I ordered
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, then I will immediately place a larger order, but after all, I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And I could not have guessed that the past year would turn out to be different from what I had thought, and I could not have redeemed and clarified it in a timely manner.
But the damage was done as a customer, and I don’t accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to meet the requirements of the dynamic driver who values reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are manufactured by casting and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All ground lenses are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain lenses and models.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which deals with the machining of the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
The padded discs produced in this way ensure high levels of comfort and braking efficiency.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of brake discs and pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted windows underline the character of each car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man at the southern fork of the American River discovered glowing lumps in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and prosperous towns in the state.
Areas were staked out, tents set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust"!
In this game you are a pioneer who is looking for wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You'll search for gold, recruit workers, breed horses, and build businesses.
You'll also get the chance to explore the surrounding waterways and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other trailblazers seem to have the same idea!
You have to out-pioneer your peers, or you're going to be left behind.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions at the same time, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called “engine building ”).
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can fine-tune your individual playing style.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a blockade!
This deactivates one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The announcer rotates to a new location at the start of each round, changing the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e. has covered each location once, and the year ends.
There's a shootout where players have to defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
When the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is calculated.
The player with the most points wins!
For free shipping, I take the shipping method up to the dimensions 35 x 25 cm x 4.5 cm, goods delivery (games included).
In all other cases mostly DPD insured and with shipment tracking (games are wrapped in bubble wrap and packing paper).
If you are a collector, then I can also send the card in a cardboard box for an additional fee of 2 euros, which means 100% no printing sites.
"Why children are not tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW mental abuse, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary appeared on my Twitter timeline today, and I immediately looked at it.
> The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures all over Europe.
His book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) sparked a fierce debate about parenting.
Former patients and carers are now making serious allegations against him.
Please be warned, the film is hard to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It must never, ever, ever be about us parents and other adults having power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is meaningful and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the abolition of the test requirement for triple vaccinated people
The health ministers of the Länder want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide abolition of the test requirement for triple vaccinated people.
‘Our countries need clarity quickly as to whether and when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times’, said Klaus Holetschek (CSL), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to ‘Bild am Sonntag’.
The removal of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD), has promised "that he will make a proposal to the Conference of Health Ministers on Tuesday". - afp
So I'm going to send the lamp back
What is the best way for me to proceed?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't make any more purchases through my #PRS_ORG#
Message: Ups, there was an error.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# website on a computer is possible.
I have updated my account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is referred to as *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anaesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Hearing noises/voices is most common, seeing images is less common, and feeling pain is the rarest.
Relevant for this topic: Cesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as a very deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
Previous episodes of awareness should be discussed during the pre-anesthesia interview.
Certain anesthesia techniques, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), carry a slightly increased risk.
* * EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment of mine describes Awareness correctly, but * * u / Nitemarex * * did not have it by definition.
Misread her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won’t help us there.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check if they will at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
That costs us a lot of money.
I already sent you an email that you didn't respond to.
Again, the question.
The order and invoice state that the goods are to be delivered to a room of my choice.
The forwarder is Company #NAME#.
I was just calling from there.
I was told that they would only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG.
Is that true?
If yes, I have to cancel the order, because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture upstairs.
Will I not be called?
I had asked a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle died at the age of 97
He has made a name for himself as a theatre critic and as an artistic director.
He later wrote a monumental history of the theatre.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man grows old".
The shattering diary of a slow farewell to the world that the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the news comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I want to thank my life here".
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common types of pallets is the European pallet, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European region.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria each year is not recorded
New York wins MLS championship for the first time
New York City FC have won the Major League Soccer title for the first time.

In the Eastern Conference final, New York beat Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Roulade Tips & Tricks
I had gotten a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
It was there for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
So thank you again :)
Now I've got the taste for it and want to cook roast beef for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, I only have a big pot.
What happens now?
What about the books, and how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I get by
IEs are about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01. that the refund had been made.
But to this day, I have not received the money.
Could you please check that?
Where there is still Christmas roast in the Lübeck area
For many people, goose or duck is as much a part of Christmas as the Christmas tree and the presents.
Have you not yet purchased poultry?
Time is running out.
We reveal where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube preamp contributes significantly to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amp sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level and the distortion content of your sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers of the VT + series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and the distortion.
Even higher up, it already sounded as if you could use the POWER LEVEL regulator to smooth out a power reserve when it gets loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controls, the full potential of the VT + series can be used in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line out.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or direct recordings.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite tunes.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also buy a VFS5 foot pedal, you can also easily call up the sounds by foot, switch the effect blocks on / off and "feel" the tempo of the effects that are compatible with it.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But had seen it differently with others.
Is there a way for you to send the lamp back?
Because it's too low for an eating table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the coming weeks?
Hello, have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
If that's not possible, I'd be happy with a bequest or gift certificate.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are then a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws are included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
That is not a satisfactory answer and the wait has not been worth it
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in nuclear deal talks
According to Iran, progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the issues that are on the agenda," Iran's top negotiator Ali Bagheri told the IRNA news agency on Sunday.
This is a ‘positive and important development’, because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a nearly one-week break.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the talks.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony as state with highest Corona infection rate
Thuringia has taken over from Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia has exceeded the 1000 mark in the Corona infection rate on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value as 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which has always had the highest incidence in Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the infection rate in Thuringia had dropped slightly, but was still above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths in connection with an infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were being treated in intensive care units.
There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, the health authorities have been overburdened for weeks and are barely keeping up with the recording of new cases.
I understand that.
As the shipment is not due until early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print that out and stick it on the package and mail it, right?
Do I not have to click/enter/fill in anything else here?
That is what I want to avoid, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to take the return at my own expense.
In my opinion, €8 return shipping is cheeky.
It's time for change
I am greeted by the German Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why is the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past few months of the Bundestag, you can see one thing: it is not extinct.
We got into a winter drought and extended the summer hole by a few months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what was it?
For the most part, that's probably just a matter of being dissatisfied with how things have gone and how we're doing in general.
In recent days, there has been a growing impression that many here are still really looking forward to the Bundestag.
#WhatWeNeedToChange
At this point, the community around the German parliament is being asked what it wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who in the last few days became aware of this project and found, simply put, a pile of rubbish.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have come together to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly call on everyone to participate, only in this way can this project also have a future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange with each other, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Goals:
* How will the Bundestag function in the future?
* Which existing systems need to be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How will new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I forgot a lot, but that's not bad, we ended up with the Discord.
If you're up for it and have the time, come to Discord, work with us, and let's democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you for this, which is still to be delivered.
Now I see that the item is too big/bulky for that and not to my taste.
For this, I have already ordered another suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the # NAME # is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: the day cover # PRS _ ORG #, is it also available in oversize, so in 240 / 240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the defective cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to do it now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for pickup - they must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can call me at any time to arrange a pickup date.
Is there an installation guide?
How much time would I have to get these and decide whether to return them?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She herself once lived vegetarian for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself was a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned interim step, I answered honestly without much thought.
That is, I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal torture.
That's why I decided to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that on her side there was some displeasure, she then defended vegetarianism and said that she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian she reduced animal suffering.
Now I'm wondering if my answer was too blunt?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan you are quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise, without you wanting it.
It greets a vegan who loves harmony (;
This is clearly not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
Your # PRS _ ORG # does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am not picking up my return at #PRS_ORG# on the assigned date.
Since I cannot be there in person due to a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed.
Please assign me an alternative pick-up date.
From the 1st of February #NUMBER# I will be available again.
Lahnstein equipped for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the state
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, handed over a grant of 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein at Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this matter," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte.
The ambulance is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, one has to reckon permanently with increasing commitments: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following their recommendations to sync, remove and re-download the app, NOTHING worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and now I am hoping for help.
Okay, so it is.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for taking the time to look into this matter, I have also spent almost a decade in government service in a similar capacity, that is to say we were also weapons carriers in the executive, I do not want to go into this further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplistic.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, even in special uniform and weapons bearers people should be right of conservative magically attractive should also be clear to everyone, that these people can then of course deal with the lived reality can also be clear, because you have, of course, in addition to the average white, meanwhile many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and by that I mean now not the overly feminine stereotype homosexuals, because there are in the executive rather less to none but quite normal men and women who you do not notice when they do not tell you) and also on these people I can and must rely, because in doubt they save your life or set this for you.
But also these marginal groups, even if it sounds funny, represent a conservative attitude in my experience, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less abducted by exaggerated left-wing politics, even if this policy allegedly advocates for them or thinks it has to do right by them, but they just want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, because of course the police and the armed forces will also be a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that endanger the state is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers, who have often been deployed abroad, often begin to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that right-wing like-minded people get together and have a lively exchange of ideas.
However, in my opinion, such things are well combated and also counteracted with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled and that is also my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don’t understand is that I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your acknowledgement of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've chatted with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, could you still deliver the other # PRS _ ORG # basket for # NUMBER # Euro in black to Germany or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I always only find you as a partner company.
but on the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves that have been filled with something yellow
and there's a small scratch on the mirror itself
Orderly by child?
Hello, I (w32) have been working on something for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I get it more wrong than right to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases when everything is left lying around, and then and again, I tidy up.
But it's never really "someone could just drop by spontaneously."
My husband is (unfortunately) also not better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the household simply loses against work and displeasure.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get your act together?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and I've been thinking about it for a while.
Because for me I have no incentive, it simply does not bother me, as long as no one visits and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have a bigger incentive with a child or do you stay lazy?
I look forward to your responses.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality as well as anatomically preformed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows an almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-moulded with special further moulding at the joints for improved freedom of movement (elbow and knee flexion)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, elbows and knee bends)
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and in the seat provide a close-fitting, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and attaching equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) insulation on the face at the hood increases comfort, insulation and durability (separate hood)
Soft, collar-like zone improves sealing with a fine-adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, gentle Velcro closure that does not stick to the casing or seams
Double cuffs with zip fasteners at arm and ankle joints combine a reversible inner cuff with a soft, padded neoprene outer cuff
45 ° taper at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and resilience when pulling on.
Long zip fastener on the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood
Langer G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and machined water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)

Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the buckles to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels glued together with external and internal overlap
Edges of outer sleeves reinforced for greater durability
Notched edges of inner cuffs for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist computers)
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I did an apprenticeship in software development and have been out of work for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking for a long time about starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have an insecure (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
In other words, I have low self-esteem and am correspondingly shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have often been told that I seem unapproachable (which I think I have gotten better at).
Can I become a social worker?
I don ’ t want to work as a street worker or in an open youth centre, but rather in, for example, addiction counselling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual working day is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something about it on the Internet.
The MVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it pulls me down every time there is something to complain about in my code ("again, the simplest things go wrong") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should by now really know how it works" / "I keep him from his work with my stupid questions" / "he must really think I am mentally retarded" etc.).
I'm probably going to have problems in any job but I wanted to mention it.
But did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I'm waiting for a pick-up date
What do they mean by return please!
When I download a book from #PRS_ORG# I get the message Your #PRS_ORG# does not authorise this book
Are there any problems?
I was in chat with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) ingested with the food is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds from these again its own protein substances, which it also needs for the formation of its plumage.
Feather formation in the nestling and feather regeneration in the moulted bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal ’ s entire organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio must not be administered during breeding, as this may lead to disturbances in the breeding cycle.
Following this intermittent administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

1 g of NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water / soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water / food daily.
One level tablespoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON Bio.
In the case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the approach of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is given until feather regrowth is complete.
Storage: Nekton-Bio should be stored in a dry place without direct sunlight, between 15 ° and 25 ° C.
I'm sorry, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to let you know that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a municipal employee in contradiction to the statute
Hello r/legaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
A claim has also been filed with the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnuts, is not part of the bylaws.
However, the walnut is explicitly listed as a tree to be protected in the constitution.
Can I rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the constitution is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a legacy or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
yes, I think so, but the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the carpet delivered to Germany
Can you check that?
Breaking news: Serious traffic accident near Selb
A serious traffic accident has recently occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the police press release (14:03), a car overtook in the opposite direction.
There are injuries.
Ah okay, I understand.
Good, then many thanks again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for a further career
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is just reconsidering everything that can be reconsidered.
Before I get into this, in short: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation - so from you.
I’m just doing the Ref as a newcomer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in a field there (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I won't say anything more specific here).
But it was all too boring for me and I was looking for alternatives that could be more fun.
At some point I ended up in the teaching profession and was sure that this was it - even if the framework conditions are much less flexible than in my previous job, but I didn't care.
I'm now on my third "I'm googling other job postings."
And it’s only been six months.
Before the paintings I always decided to go on and at least finish the ref, after that I can still change my mind.
But I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little free time in the last month that I'm completely drained.
Now it is the holidays, but there is still a pile of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was my weekend and my happy hour was my happy hour.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn't matter at the time.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more.
Basically, it's fun, and from the outside looking in, the ref is doing a good job, in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely drained and wonder how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it isn't already.
I wonder if I want to have that for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here -, or if I should go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, could take my free time when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but paid accordingly and worked together in a team and not as a lone fighter as it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if in a year's time I won't be back at the same place I'm at now and be dissatisfied.
You see, it's all a bit of a mess, but maybe you, as an outsider, have some advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation that I'm completely done with and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I’m not going to make any decisions right now, that probably won’t lead to anything good.
But maybe your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thanks for reading and sorry for the whiny undertone.
I hope my situation is at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has been continuously developed, which has led, among other things, to the combination of the advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, with which the behavior of a tube amplifier is perfectly reproduced.
With the VT20X / VT40X / VT100X Amps we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of the components and Amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX Amplifiers offer a closed cabinet and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just bubble.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, until the amp and the effects sound the way you always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Naturally, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 once again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics as well as numerous and decisively improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20 + to the VT120 + with two speakers, the new VT + Valvetronix series has been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack as well as a prompt address.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that it is primarily the final stage that determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The Valve Reactor circuit of every VT + amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers
Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine – but it is not enough to beat the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven rebounds from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually positionable and foldable Velcro closures, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for every type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What finally fits in the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a hot shoe flash.
Larger DSLR cameras such as the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for more lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilms X-A or E series) you can use the backpack for your equipment and for photofree things.
Even drone pilots make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20 L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, lava flows on the Canary Island have caused extensive damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
The activity of the as yet unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists still dare not predict when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," the president of the island council, Mariano Hernandez Zapata, told state broadcaster RTVE.
Damage in the millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000 degree Celsius lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick layer of lava.
That is almost 1,700 football pitches.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new peninsulas with a combined size of about 50 hectares were created off the coast by cooled lava.
The banana industry, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly hard hit. About half of the 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly from the banana industry, which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely damaged, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is approaching and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still brings our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-promoting "social contract of nature peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How St. Nicholas became Santa Claus
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with the giving of presents.
Previously, on St. Nicholas Day, gifts were given in one way or another.
The background of this custom, which is still popular today, is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women in one night in order to spare them a further life in sin.
This unconventional way of giving gifts gave rise to the popular German custom of filling the shoes, especially those of children, with gifts.
Protestants object to this custom because they reject mediators between God and people as "idolatry."
For these reasons, they are wary of the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child, establishing a new tradition.
The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such details so closely, it only irritates the few that the custom of St. Nicholas, like the custom of Martin, is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas season with Martin singing and Martin migration.
Today, you can find everything your heart desires from socks to coveted luxury watches outside the door and under the Christmas tree in your boots.
A variety of traditions in Christian countries
Sources attest to a tradition of gift-giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a happy muddle over the question of who brings the presents to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ child appears on Christmas Eve or Santa Claus, who in principle is a kind of Santa Claus, to whom over time some peculiarities have been attributed.
These include, for example, his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought some fame to Father Frost.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the handing over of the gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near royal palace
An armed man was shot dead by police near Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
Police said callers reported a man armed with a gun entering a bank and a bookkeeper's business.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers.
Shots were fired and the man was hit.
He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The police did not suspect a terrorist background.
The area around Kensington Palace is home to several embassies.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
On the other hand, Smart Stone is completely harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly – in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The borderless, amorphous design is a conscious choice: like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rockery.
He also does well in the neighbourhood of larger pebbles and agates, where he can hold his own thanks to his size.
You can save a lot of preparatory work: As a solar lamp, Smart Stone does not need any wiring or batteries.
Place the » Luminous Stone « on any sunlit place.
Two included earth pegs provide a firm grip when needed.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
Its solar module discreetly hides » Smart Stone « inside, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the case.
At the onset of dusk, Smart Stone begins to glow on its own; you can choose the colour yourself: there are six attractive light colours to choose from – in addition to daylight white.
Finally, the shutdown also takes place automatically once the battery charge level has fallen to a predetermined minimum or it gets light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts on the next day from the beginning.
I've done that several times, it doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello ladies,
I hope I'm doing this right, this is actually my first post on reddit after a year.
To my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had incredibly bad cramps during my period and shitty PMS before my period.
Now I would like to leave it again, because I already have to take enough medication for chronic illnesses, which I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten from 0 to 100 explosive pimples all over my body during my last two year break.
As shallow as that, but it really got to me and I didn't feel good about it.
In the two years since, nothing has really normalised.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid that this time.
My makeup is already fragrance-free and hypoallergenic, but maybe there's something someone can recommend to me.
The gynaecologist unfortunately did not take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Thank you to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had Vorbupertär bad neurodermatitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale nodular psoriasis and the acne topic.
I have also tried everything in the course of a Christian illness and have remained on ner sugar, milk and meat mixed food because nothing else really worked.
It can also be good that hormonally it's just the worm in there, but if you want to have a construction site everywhere like me, you just don't want to search anymore what else is going wrong.
I already had everything of her colleague semino.
Written and now I've lost the thread of the conversation and don't know what was replied to my query.
I have to work in between and to the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
what is there to check, if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong
but is it generally large
because it is available in large sizes in black

In the name of the people: lay judges pass sentences
In the courtroom, they sit on the bench in everyday clothes.
But much depends on their verdict, even if they are not wearing a robe: jurors decide, together with professional judges, whether and for how long someone will go behind bars.
Two of them told "Oeffentliche" about their time at the Bad Kreuznach Regional Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the Regional Court on John F. Kennedy Street.

110 kV underground cable to be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria’s plan approval decision paves the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.

All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what happens next?
A beautiful start to the week!
You can forget that, I explained that several times yesterday!
This is a wardrobe made of glass and all the sides are broken, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The dresser is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# rules
That means the dresser can't be picked up because no one is allowed in my apartment
Thanks for the message
but why only 20 EUR?
The original price of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's with all books, that's why I asked #PRS_ORG# because it's probably a general problem
Ref: Planning lessons (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have big problems planning my lessons in geography in a time-efficient way.
Unfortunately, my school is not very well equipped technically, so I can only use the blackboard, the textbook and an overhead projector as a medium.
At school I can only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
Currently, I just need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently working on the topic of geo-factors, and for me, every hour is its own thing.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I also do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I actually always start with the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the assignments in the book I'm rather dissatisfied.
Hence the work sheets.
Maybe I can ask a geography teacher how to work efficiently with the book.
That would really make me happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided for a new one at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to return the old one as soon as possible.
Retailers are worried about the Christmas season due to the 2G rule.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed in.
The trade says this is unnecessary and bemoans the loss of sales.
He also has a possible solution ready.
From the perspective of the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for retailers.
Stefan Genth, HDE’s chief executive officer, criticized the fact that sales of non-daily necessities have fallen.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
Only the food retail trade and the online sector are doing well.
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The shopping with masks, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
"2G shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a lot of manpower.
He demanded that the volume regulation be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores with the wristband on that day.
In addition, in retail, as is already the case in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested), random checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas season.
Frequencies were last at around 75 percent of pre-coronavirus levels without 2G, while sales were at around 90 percent.
These figures will certainly fall in the middle of such an important Christmas shopping season," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche" magazine.
Due to the high personnel and administrative costs, solutions are being sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, in which "visitors can, for example, provide proof of their 2G status at a central point in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel, be able to enter all the shops undisturbed." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a mistake on the frame, which was attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler.
It looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sealed it.
How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual Balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 – 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to use.
The luminaire produces a very high luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker.
The 120 degree angle of illumination, which allows you to illuminate large areas at relatively small distances, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It's a great tool for working both on set and in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the luminaire in television studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory cards, it is simply done by holding down one of the memory buttons for a longer period of time.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that when the lamp is switched on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, if the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate on cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester with built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlamp with electricity via the supplied power supply.
The construction of the spotlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm socket for mounting, so you can attach them directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be set reliably with the help of set screws on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a ball-and-socket joint is included in the delivery.
Brilliant that it also comes with a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the lantern with all the accessories you may still want to buy without any problems.
Damn, I got that as a gift and it's too small :(
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a goal-laden comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, Hesse, who had not won a series in the last two games, seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga debacle.
But then the SGE turned it around, shot themselves within a good hour of the frustration of a season opener and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have achieved today," coach Oliver Glasner exulted on DAZN and spoke a "general praise to everyone who was involved."
At first, it looked like another dampener for the Frankfurt team, which is still in ninth place and is still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen 2-0 up.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I'm absolutely delighted with the performance we showed and, of course, the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play for the first time since the fourth matchday and his overcome muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old, delighted with the result especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, however, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself, but also sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is exceptional that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in a top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live a highly professional life.
Now, they want to "move forward step by step and remain modest" and carry out the tasks until the turn of the year "at this level".
Next up is a trip to Borussia Monchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (18:30, Sky).
I get the mail that my package is returned to you due to an error on my part.
Tried to call #PRS_ORG# and get them to redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent back to me directly or do I have to wait until the money is returned and place the order again?
Unfortunately, that would mean that I would not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Handball women’s quarter-final against Spain
Germany’s women’s handball team slinked off the court with their heads down and eyes empty after their humiliation at the hands of Denmark.
At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a bitter defeat at 16-32 (8-13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to run against host Spain in the quarter-finals.
"We were far too timid and had far too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
We have to play differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second in the main round group III with 8:2 points behind the Danish women (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us.
That was a bad game from all of us, which we need to forget," said captain Emily Bölk.
In the battle for a place in the semi-finals, there must be a significant increase against the 2019 World Cup runners-up next Tuesday in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backfield player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We just weren't there - neither in the attack nor in the defense," midfielder Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We have to look ahead quickly now."
Not level from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at its best at the start.
Wasted chances and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with a few parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
However, this was not the hoped-for initial ignition.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly get a foothold – and if they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
The game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since defensive player Mia Zschocke saw red a short time later for a hard foul on her opponent.
However, she will be able to participate again in the quarter-finals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection play a bit better and at least got close to five goals until the break.
The faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is one of the medal contenders in the final round.
As a result, the German team could no longer muster the strength to improve their performance and left the court as clear losers.
DACH Advent calendar Day 6: Family traditions at Christmas time
As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we ’ ve cobbled together St. Nicholas Day and are using it as an excuse to celebrate family traditions in the pre-Christmas season, Advent, Santa Claus, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays.

I would like to donate a gift code
just like with #PRS_ORG gift vouchers
What happens to them?
The title is given, I am working as an immunization doctor in mobile immunization teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech / Pfizer vaccine is administered, mainly in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be finished for the most part, they will then go on to vaccination centres for me.
I am happy to answer questions without time limit to the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, is this compatible with the vaccination..").
In my area of responsibility falls the information for vaccination, the indication (person has a right to vaccination according to the Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, who cannot (may not?) carry out vaccinations, so that I also carry out most vaccinations myself there.
Serious ‘hairdresser’ question: Amberger knows the answer
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect word, sent in by an Amberg resident, caused a lot of thought in the BR television programme "We in Bavaria".
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the "Host mi?" series this time remained unguessed by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "person who is nervous."
And also no one who "has to do everything quickly".
That, the people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
The man from Amberg then revealed the solution, which caused astonishment among many people in Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer," viewers were told, "is a rag used to wipe out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
This closed a gap in education – even for those who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I have not been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always occurs: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I've rebooted the #PRS_ORG# g#PRS_ORG# n, connected it to the PC, synced it and fixed it.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice for racing bicycles – is it really fail-safe?
This morning I woke up full of motivation, because I wanted to train at least a little bit to prepare for my bike tour next week.
Said, done and off I went on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then it happened what lurks in every inner city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire did not want to participate in the rest of the route under any circumstances.
Since I did not have a real chance to get a replacement coat and replacement hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with a halfway bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn ’ t that bad technically, maybe it ’ s better if I practice changing tires again before the bike tour.
But now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance over several days ahead of me, I would not like to get this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, ripped off 140km on the day I picked up the bike until 14: 12!) and who had already called them suboptimal, because he had been riding on them for more years.
But if I think about the fact that I still have to change a tire after driving 80-90 km, then I think I'm really in a bad mood: D
Now I got into a conversation with an older man at the train platform who asked me in surprise why I did not have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unflatable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I have little desire now to spend 40€/tire just to be disappointed.
I also ask myself: I currently have 25x622 on my road bike.
These are also available (apparently) on the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me to use other tyres on a racing bike?
The Swallow page seems to be my absolute! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and best regards!

After the release of our new high-end B 100-6 OHM ribbon cable, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get a successor.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and visually reminds of the great role models with the B 200-6 OHM.
However, in this construction proposal, a specially designed foot is included to lift the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no effect on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
Due to the principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people for whom the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role, but who want to achieve an exceptionally high sound level.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not capable of producing such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
But that doesn't mean the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, she walks in with considerable maturity and is extremely impressive and accurate for her size.
The SOLO 15 has been tuned to a slightly higher pitch.
This is generally common in broadband to optimize the excessively high frequencies strongly increasing bundling.
Aimed precisely at the listening position, the SOLO 15 convinces with a very clear and fine sound.
The treble range can be slightly turned outwards, reducing the sound image and making it warmer.
Thanks to the point source, the localization of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is razor-sharp and astonishingly precise.
The reference-suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100-6 OHM create an enemy dynamic that seeks its equal.
The SOLO 15 not only complements our SOLO series, but also expands it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to think about the final appearance of the loudspeaker at the beginning, in order to plan appropriate changes during construction.
If you want to furnish the cabinets, for example, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, since the veneer applies material again.
After all the boards have been cut (e.g. in the hardware store), you should first drill an 8 mm hole in the floorboard at the appropriate place in order to be able to easily run the cable through it later.
With the help of an end mill, the loudspeaker opening in the front is now followed, so that the B 100-6 OHM can be used later on.
On the back side, this opening should be provided with a 45 ° phase in order to make the opening area of the loudspeaker chassis inside as large as possible.
The four screw fixing points of the B 100 -6 OHM get an interruption in the phase, as shown in the picture "Detail Phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the bottom are now glued on.
The three stiffeners should also be installed and glued.
The stiffeners themselves can vary in material thickness if necessary, for example if you want to use ready-made skirting boards from the hardware store instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side will be attached.
This is followed by all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The fitting of the openings of the bass reflex tube, as well as the connection clamp on the back wall, is facilitated by a suitable jigsaw or a Forstner drill.
After that, a router is used to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top of the footplate can also be rounded off.
Afterwards, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the case and additionally screwed with long wood screws.
This is followed by the marking and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the fastening points of the loudspeaker chassis and the connection clamp.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (vacuuming / blowing), you can start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
In doing so, the entire and uncut cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm bore into the foot to the terminal opening and is left about 30 cm protruding there.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable to the speaker opening is led and is also left hanging loosely there.
The frequency shift is then prepared and applied.
The construction plan of the frequency changer, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions Weiche Solo 15.
Once the frequency divider is installed and the terminal block is tightened, the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box is sealed, which is not yet completely closed.
With the 35mm bASSREFLEX opening and a bit of skill, you can let hot glue drip onto the opening and thus close it.
By opening the B 100-6 OHM and with a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Now follows the muffling, according to the description.
The B 100-6 OHM is then connected and screwed in with the appropriate screws.
The polarity plays an important role here, so the positive lead (marked cable) must be connected to the positive pole of the loudspeaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed in the housing.
The incision around the bass reflex canal should be kept open.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered in early June?
> Hello everyone,
> Finally, we can announce that we will be holding the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible for us to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per booth, so we will stream the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - so we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Get your drinks cold, plan some good food and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
