The orange one is twice as expensive.

That's why I don't feel like watching TV anymore.
Is it because it's hard for comedians? Comedians are all over TV.
I watched Iroha Chidori on Netflix yesterday, but there were a lot of scenes where the staff were laughing in the background when she said something that wasn't particularly funny.
It's clearly not funny, but "because I'm a popular comedian, don't laugh at everything I say" is a creepy giggle.
But if the staff don't laugh, the comedian's mood will be spoiled, and it will be unpleasant to work with.
It's like an old-fashioned black company in that industry, and some of the comedians are so egotistical that they have a really obnoxious attitude, so I guess if you don't do that, you can't survive.
On the other hand, there are a lot of cases where the comedian himself talks about "Don't fawn over comedians" in a way that makes it seem like he's bragging about how hard his job is.
I know that the income will be quite low until it becomes a hit, but it's not like I'm being told that I'm at the top of the most desirable jobs.
All that can be heard is justification for the glorification of one's own career and the elevated status of comedians in the media and society.
To be honest, there are some tough parts of the industry I work in, but it feels like the things that touch on the world of entertainers are getting more and more difficult.
I'm sorry for complaining.
It felt like if I didn't go out, it would be bad for my body.

Items ordered from a tsukumonet shop were replaced without permission
Offer: I ordered a wireless mouse that had gone on sale, and was told that if I wanted a refund, I had to return the wired version
It's more of a mail-order problem than a PC problem, but no matter how I think about it, it doesn't make sense, and it's a famous place, so I'll let you write about it here.
The sale of the MSI Wireless Gaming Mouse for 3,280 yen (link to Hirota Taku) at the Tsukumonettoshop's Tsukumo's Day Sale, which began last Friday, was the starting point.
At the store, the price of the wired version was the same, so I checked the price of the wired version as well, and it was 5,071 yen (Rinko Tako), so I ordered it thinking that it was not a mistake.
The order email arrived normally, and the next day's shipping email also arrived
The name "CLUTCH GM41 WIRELESS LIGHTWEIGHT" was written in both emails and on the purchase history of the MyPage.
Since there was no contact or cancellation notice from the time of placing the order to the time of shipping, I thought that the wireless mouse I ordered would arrive at this point.
The problem was that a few hours after the shipment, I received an email saying, "There was an error in the registration of the product."
According to the email
* The wireless version was sold at a sale price, but it was actually a wired version
* Wired mice are already shipping,
1. All canceled after rejecting delivery
2. Return only the mouse and get a refund
3. Use a wired mouse as is
Choose how to respond
There are separate product pages for the wired and wireless versions, and the purchase history, the email, and the delivery slip all say "wireless version," but it seems that the wired version was sent instead.
I was sent something different from what I ordered, and if I want a refund, I have to send it back. Isn't that terrible?
In the end, I want to make a comeback, so please lend me your wisdom.

The only bridge connecting the area to the outside world was washed away due to the typhoon and heavy rain, leaving the town isolated for the second time. Residents are stocking up on three times the usual amount of food (Yatomi, Fukushima Prefecture) (Fukushima TV) - Yahoo!News
Mr. Matsumoto Yoshitaro, from the highland area of Yatsukawa, Fukushima Prefecture.
The 2019 East Japan typhoon had a huge impact on the lives of 3 households of 8 people.
Mr. Matsumoto: "At first it was like, 'Really?'
It felt like, "Will it break so easily? Will it be washed away?" The only road connecting the Takahara area, Takahara Bridge, was washed away by the East Japan typhoon, leaving 30 residents of 11 households isolated.
Residents who were forced to cut off their water used the JR steel bridge, which is normally off-limits to the public, to transport necessary supplies on a daily basis.
Mr. Matsumoto: "Usually, a car can drive all the way to the garden, but here, you have to get off the car, carry it, or put it on your back, and walk across the iron bridge to get here, so I felt the inconvenience of not having a car." The makeshift bridge, which was completed a month later, was washed away by heavy rain in less than three months, leaving the area isolated for a few days until a temporary bridge was set up.
More than two years have passed since the disaster, and recovery has progressed, but Matsumoto continues to take preventive measures based on the lessons learned.
Mr. Matsumoto: "I think there are about 10 cases.
First and foremost, I want to make sure we have enough food for 2-3 days, so I've tripled the amount of canned food and instant noodles we have compared to before the disaster."
Ms. Matsumoto: "It's not someone else's problem, but you never know when disaster will strike, so it's better to have a little bit of savings, I thought." On the other hand, the town of Yasakai experienced the "unexpected disaster" of bridges being washed away.
In order not to forget the lessons, the town began its own initiative in 2021.
Takahashi Ryuichi, Head of the Education Department, Yayamatsuri Town: "We have designated October 12th as 'Yayamatsuri Town Disaster Prevention Day', and we have also made an announcement that from next year onwards, October 12th will be a day to think about disaster prevention.
It's made me more aware than ever that unexpected things can happen."

Experience a marathon in VR (Tokyo MX) - Yahoo!News
On December 12th, 2021, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government will hold an event where you can run the Paralympic marathon course digitally.
This event was held to allow people to experience the new fun of sports and the charm of Tokyo's tourism through digital means.
Running machines and road bikes were set up at the venue, and people who visited the venue ran along the Paralympic marathon course recreated in the virtual space with special equipment.
Each tablet that projects the virtual space has an avatar of the participant appear, allowing them to compete with other participants from home and abroad as they run the marathon course, while also being able to enjoy the sights of Tokyo.
Participants said, "The scenery has changed so much and it was so much fun."
"While running through the streets of Tokyo like this, it's hard while running, but it's great to be able to run while enjoying it, and I think it's great that I was able to compete with everyone until the end," said a Tokyo official, adding, "I want to make it enjoyable for people to come to the gym in the future."

(Diamond Online) - Yahoo!News
● New "Building Condition Survey" system created to revitalize the second-hand housing market Second-hand housing transactions are booming.
The price of prefabricated houses and condominiums is rising, and the renovation market is also expanding.
While the desire to own a home is on the rise due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the popularity of properties represented by the words "in front of the station," "near the station," and "directly connected to the station," "large-scale," and "tower" has soared, and this has likely contributed to a decrease in the number of relatively cheap new buildings.
However, compared to overseas countries, Japan's existing (second-hand) housing circulation share is still at a low level.
Therefore, in 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) amended part of the Real Estate Transaction Law, and started a building condition survey, called an "inspection", aimed at providing a safe and secure second-hand home (https: / /www. mlit.go.jp/common/ 0012199 00.pdf).
This is a system in which an architect who is an expert in residential buildings checks the current condition of the property, including deterioration, and summarizes it in a report, which is then presented to the buyer.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport explains that the introduction of inspections will benefit both buyers and sellers.
By conducting an inspection of the property before the sale, the seller can avoid claims after the property has been handed over, giving the buyer peace of mind.
This will also lead to the differentiation of competitive cases.
On the other hand, for buyers, it is a system that allows them to understand the condition of the pre-owned house they are planning to buy, and to accept it and buy it, and at first glance, it seems to be a system with great benefits.
However, under the current system, it is mainly the seller who has the right to lead the building condition survey.
Furthermore, it is important to note that only the notification of the inspection system is mandatory.
In other words, real estate agents who act as intermediaries have the obligation to explain whether they can or cannot "introduce an architect to conduct a building condition survey" during the mediation process, but the act itself is not mandatory.
In an inspection led by the seller, there are risks to be concerned about, but if you look overseas, in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, where the used car market is thriving, similar systems are already in place.
In the early stages of buying and selling a house, the buyer is required to have a building survey carried out by a specialist called an "inspector" or "building surveyor".
For example, in the United States, depending on the state, 70 to 90% of used home transactions have an inspection.
In the sense that the "buyer" is in charge of the inspection, it is very different from the Japanese-style inspection, where the "seller" is in charge.
On the seller's side, they want to show the condition of the building as well as possible, and sell it as quickly and as high a price as possible.
The buyers, on the other hand, are mulling over the contents of the survey and thinking about making the necessary repairs so they can live in peace of mind.
Even if it is the same inspection, there is a discrepancy between the goals and intentions of both sides.
For this reason, the Japanese system has been pointed out as a risk to be concerned about in the following points.
● The scope of the inspection, which is seller-led as stipulated by the government, will be kept to a minimum.
Because it is not a detailed survey, there is a risk of overlooking really important defects ● For the inspection company, the intermediary company (seller) that introduces the case they are in charge of can be considered a customer.
As a result, there is a possibility that inspections will be carried out that do not report unfavorable survey results to the seller.

If there is a history of employment at the company, even if it is for personal reasons, it can be changed to a company-related resignation by the doctor's decision, so the threshold for receiving unemployment insurance and so on will drop drastically.

As proof of this... " It's only in Ginza that you can show off a bit of trivia.
Let's introduce some interesting Ginza trivia that you'll want to share with someone.
Going over Ginza!?
First infiltration of the Golden Seat
As you walk around Ginza, you can see the remnants of the history of the Ginza area everywhere, such as unusual place names, mysterious stone monuments, and numerous shrines.
While walking with her in Ginza, a sudden silence ensued. "This used to be the Peninsula.
Ginza used to be a peninsula?
Ginza in Chuo-ku, Tokyo, is the epitome of a bustling shopping district that produces "Ginza" all over Japan.
The term "Ginza" originally referred to a mint for silver coins, and in 1612 (the 17th year of the Keicho era), the Ginza Office, which was located in what is now Shizuoka City, was moved to Edo.
At the time, it was called "Shinryogai-cho", but when it moved to Kaiji-cho, it became known as "Ginza".
Ginza used to be a "peninsula" jutting out into the sea.
Prior to the Edo period, the inlet stretched from Hibiya to Marunouchi, and from Nipponbashi to Ginza, there was a peninsula called "Edo-mae-shima".
The tip of that peninsula is what is now Ginza.
When Tokugawa Ieyasu opened the shogunate in Edo, he filled in the inlet and began developing the area around Kyobashi.
Furthermore, Ieyasu had canals dug around the neighborhood in order to develop shipping.
They then dug out the dirt from the ditches and cut down the mountains of Kanda to fill in the inlet.
Also, there is a stone monument called "The Birthplace of Ginza" in front of Tiffany Ginza Main Store (2-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku), which marks the site of the Ginza Office, so if you're interested, why don't you look for it?
A "pilgrimage" to Ginza for those in the know
In Ginza, there is a "Ginza Hacho Meiji Shrine Pilgrimage", a "pilgrimage" known only to those in the know, which is held every year.
Among the more than 10 shrines in the area, the easiest to spot is the Kabuki Inari Shrine in front of the Kabuki Theatre.
The shrine at the right end of the Kabuki-za is visited by many people before and after performances.
On the one hand, the "Ryūkō-Fudō-Zen" is located on the rooftop of Matsuya in Ginza, and the "Ginza Debut Jizō-Zen" is located at the Ginza Terrace on the 9th floor of Mitsukoshi in Ginza.
The "Hozan Inari Shrine", "Azuma Inari Shrine", and "Toyama Inari Shrine" are located at the back of the alley, and are not easy to find, but the "Toyama Inari shrine" is known to have been revered by the kabuki actor Ichimura Uzaemon. The "Seikyo Inari Shrine" located at the entrance of the Shiseido Ginza Building on the 1st floor is closed to the public except during the Eight-day Festival.
While there are shrines that worship Fudomu Myo-o and Jizo Bosatsu, most of the shrines are dedicated to Inari.
The Inari Shrine, where foxes greet you at the entrance, was built in abundance in places where there are many farmers, as it is said to bring good harvests.
As a result, in large cities such as Kyoto and Edo, it was said to be profitable, and in Japan's number one shopping district, Ginza, it also spread.

Male body found in the Suwa River in Moriyama-ku, Nagoya (Nagoya TV NEWS) - Yahoo!News
On the morning of the 12th, a man was found lying face down in the Suwa River in the Suwa area of Nagoya City.
The police are investigating the man's identity and cause of death.
According to the police, at around 11:30am on the 12th, a passerby spotted a man lying face down in the Shonai River in Nakashibatake, Moriyama-ku, and called 110.
The man was rescued from the river, but was pronounced dead at the scene.
While the police are in a hurry to confirm the identity, they are also investigating the cause of death.
On the other hand, a man in his 70s was found lying in the river in Sakagawa, Fukuoka-cho, Okazaki City, and was confirmed dead.
The man's clothes were not dishevelled, but there was a bicycle lying nearby.
While the police are in a hurry to identify the man, they are also investigating the circumstances of the incident.
In mid-February, residents who are exempt from paying residential taxes will receive a payment, but will it be paid out even if one member of the household is exempt?
It seems like confirmation documents will be sent out from today...

South Korea's POSCO International acquires Australia's Senex Energy, expands overseas gas business: Korea report (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo!News
Posco International announced on the 12th that it had concluded a stock purchase agreement with Senex Energy of Australia, as well as an investment agreement for the acquisition of Hancock Energy and Senex Energy.
There are still some procedures to be completed, such as the approval of the shareholders' meeting of Senex Energy and the approval of the local subsidiary, and the acquisition procedures are expected to be completed by March next year.
This acquisition is the largest global M&A case since Posco International was merged into Posco Group in 2010.
The total purchase price was 770.9 billion won, with POSCO International investing 50.1% and Hancock Energy 49.9%.
Posco International explained that it decided to make the acquisition because it believes that natural gas demand will continue to increase in the era of energy transition, and that blue hydrogen, which is based on natural gas, will split the hydrogen market with green hydrogen.
With this acquisition, Posco International will secure 802 billion cubic feet (802Bcf) of natural gas reserves, which is equivalent to 44% of South Korea's natural gas consumption in 2019, as well as securing personnel to operate land-based gas fields in Australia.

That knee pain, maybe it's "degenerative knee arthritis"!?
Different treatments for different causes (Medical DOC) - Yahoo!News
Editor: Recently, my knee has been hurting.
What are the possible illnesses?
Mr. Maruyama: The causes of knee pain are various, including injury, joint rheumatism, and gout attacks.
Among them, the most common condition among Japanese is "degenerative joint disease".
Editor's department: Does this mean that the joints will deform?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
Normally, the surface of the joint is covered with cartilage, which serves to cushion impacts and make joint movement smooth.
However, due to aging, obesity, or intense exercise, the cartilage can become worn down or deformed.
As a result, the joints become deformed and inflamed.
Editor: Does osteoarthritis occur in places other than the knee?
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
In addition to the knee, it can also occur in the joints of the fingers, wrists, neck, waist, big toe, and hip joints.
However, the most common is the knee, which is called "degenerative knee arthritis".
Editor: First of all, what is the structure of a joint?
Mr. Maruyama: The joint is made up of two bones that fit together.
And the part of the two bones that are facing each other is covered by the "articular cartilage", and the area around the joint is covered by the "articular capsule".
Editor: It's a complicated structure.
Mr. Maruyama: Yes.
The inner layer of the joint capsule is made up of a tissue called the synovium, which produces joint fluid.
This joint fluid serves as a lubricant and is made up of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate.
This is why it is said that "hyaluronic acid and condroitin sulfate are good for smooth knee movement."
Editor: What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis?
Mr. Maruyama: Joint cartilage has both stickiness and elasticity, and plays a role in preventing bones from directly colliding with each other.
It's like a cushion, isn't it?
However, if this is worn down or distorted, it can cause joint deformation and inflammation, resulting in pain.

3 gambling and games from the Kai-Ji series that you can actually experience (Real Sound) - Yahoo!News
The gambling manga series "Kaiji", which boasts explosive popularity among men.
One of the delights of this game is that it is a game of life and death.
[Photo] Just watching makes your legs go weak...... A challenge to walk across the steel beam!
So this time, I'd like to verify the games that can actually be played, or are being practiced in planning videos.
■ The trap-filled pachinko game "Nu ma", which appeared in the gambling-themed manga "Kaiji".
In the original, the high rate of 4,000 yen per ball surprised Kaiji.
This "swamp" is equipped with large traps such as "Nail Forest", "Movable Objects" and "3-tiered Crown", making it nearly impossible to conquer.
However, Kai-ji used every trick in the book, and in the end, he placed a vinyl aquarium on the building and sank the foundation, causing it to tilt, and managed to take it.
The "marsh" that appears in KaiJi is actually a pachinko game that many people play.
Of course, there is no "one ball for 4,000 yen" and the difficulty has been reduced, but it is possible to enjoy the feeling of Kai-ji.
The debtors, including Kaiji, were made to walk on the beams as part of the entertainment at a "star-side party" organised by a wealthy man.
The debtors proceed while trying not to fall off the narrow iron girders placed 10 meters above the ground, racing against the speed.
12 people participate, and the top two can win the prize money, but there are only four beams, and the safety measures are inadequate, so the possibility of death is quite high.
This walk across the steel girders is very dangerous, but in addition to being developed as a VR game, you can get an extremely close experience at the "Eagle Bridge" at Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles' home stadium, Rakuten Life Park Miyagi.
This Eagle Bridge is a single-span bridge made of iron and steel, 20 meters high (the equivalent of the 7th floor of a building), with a "Sky Swing" and a "Victory Bridge" set up at the end, which you walk towards.
Of course, safety measures are in place.
Comedian Koala Kozue caused a stir when she posted a video of herself walking on the Eagle's Nest Bridge on her YouTube channel, saying, "You can experience walking on a suspension bridge in Japan."
■ E Card A card game for two players, "E Card".
A total of 10 cards are used, including 1 emperor card, 8 citizen cards and 1 slave card, and the game is played in turns between the emperor side and the slave side.
This game is very well made, and the emperor is strong to the citizens, the citizens are strong to the slaves, and the slaves are strong to the emperor.
In the drama, Kaiji fights against Tone River under the harsh rule that if he loses, he will have his ears cut off.
Kai-ji, who noticed that the earpiece-like ear-destroying device, which detects changes in pulse and body temperature and transmits them, was being used to read his psychology, cut his own ears to the limit and made his body abnormal in order to confuse the Tone River and win.
The E-card is commercially available and can be purchased from Amazon.
YouTube has uploaded a video of Hikaru, a popular YouTuber, competing with Fujiwara Ryuya, who played the role of Kaiji in the movie, with an E-card, and it has become a hot topic.
■ Would you like to experience the Kaiji feeling?
No one wants to be in a situation like Kaiji's, but reading the manga does make you feel like it.
How about experiencing that worldview through the game?
A Step Towards the New Year, Gentle Encouragement with a Tora Horse Painting at Prefectural Kokoku Shrine | Yamagata Shimbun
As preparations for the New Year continue at Prefectural Kokoku Shrine (Yamagata City), a large Ema (prayer board) featuring the zodiac sign for next year, "Tora (Tiger)" has been put up.
On the 11th, students from Tohoku University of the Arts visited the shrine and held a memorial service in front of the shrine.
The shrine has been commissioning art students to create the original drawings for the ema since the previous year.
This time, the work of 22-year-old Tanigaya Yui, one of nine students in the Japanese Painting course of the Fine Arts Department, supervised by Professor Suenaga Toshiaki, was selected.
The large ema is 3.3 meters wide and about 1.8 meters tall in the center.
Mr. Tsuchiya said that he drew it to give the impression of "cherry blossoms gently pushing the back of someone starting a new year."
The image of the tiger standing still and gazing at the cherry blossoms conveys the wish that "even in a world that is changing rapidly, we can have the leisure to appreciate the beauty of nature."
Mr. Tsuchiya's design is also painted on the picture scrolls that are commonly distributed.
Kenegi Chiaki (44) said, "I think it will help everyone to overcome their difficulties."

"I want to keep living in Tamano" Idea Workshop for 4 High School Students in the City: Sanyo Shimbun Digital | San-Digi
What kind of town will Tamano be in 2030?
Student representatives from four high schools in Tamano are working together on a workshop to think about "Tamano, where we want to live."
As part of the investigation and policy proposal business of the intermediate support organization "Tamano SDGS Miraizukuri Center," they will present the voices of young people to the mayor and others.
"What makes you happy?"
When asked by the facilitator, the students answered in unison, "When I'm with a lot of people," "When I'm drumming," and so on.
It was held for the first time on November 13th at Hinode Fureai Hall.
The 18 university students and local people moved from "island" to "island" while talking about "interesting town," "easy to live in town," and "town where you can feel a sense of purpose," using the method of "World Cafe," where each person has a theme.
Each thought was written on a note and pasted on a copy of the paper.
"Towns with a lot of young people seem interesting," and "Transportation such as trains and buses are indispensable for livability."
There are no common points, so let's discuss further.
"I thought Tamano was boring, but it's charming to be able to cycle by the sea," said a third-year student (18) from Tamano Commercial and Industrial High School.
"There are few shops and it's inconvenient to get around, but it's a good place with lots of nature," said a third-year student (18) from Bizen Gakuen, speaking with the adults, who seemed to have noticed not only the problems of the area, but also its charm.
The second session, in December, will be attended only by high school students, who will organize the contents of the proposals.
It is scheduled to be announced in February next year, with the mayor and superintendent of education in attendance.
Chairman Rie Higashi of the same center said, "While nurturing high school students' love for their hometowns, if it becomes an opportunity for young people to take an active role in city-building,"

At around 12:31pm on the 12th, a magnitude 4 earthquake occurred in Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, and Saitama prefectures.
According to the Meteorological Agency, the epicenter was in the southern part of Ibaraki Prefecture, and the depth of the epicenter was about 50km.
The magnitude of the earthquake is estimated to be 5.0 on the Richter scale.
There is no need to worry about the tsunami.
The intensity of the earthquake was as follows.

How to find it: A new way to tie a scarf (Sankei Shimbun) - Yahoo!News
It's an essential winter staple, but is there ever a time when you don't need a scarf?
It's best to look in the mirror after wrapping and adjust your balance, but some people say they don't know the trick.
I was thinking that if there was a scarf that could be wrapped around my neck without getting tangled, that would be great, but then I found something brand new.
The stall of the "COTTORI" brand has a length of about one meter, which is more compact than the average size.
When I first saw it, I thought, "Is it possible to make it so short and still be able to wrap it?"
If you look closely, you can see that it is stitched together like a piece of fabric that has been cut into strips, and the whole thing is in a mesh pattern.
The mesh is designed so that the end of the stole can pass through.
So even if you don't tie the ends together, you can still tie it.
It is very light and warm, made from freeze-dried material.
This year, sleeveless gilets (vests) are popular, but many people wear them with a stole to keep their shoulders warm.
I think it would be very convenient to have a stool like this.

Beatles documentary on Disney Plus is super fun
It's called Get Buck, and it was directed by Peter Jackson
It's fresh and vivid, like a life-size Beatles.
Since it's right before the disbandment, there's a lot going on, but it's not as dramatic as I imagined.
"I know I'm annoying, but come on!" like the annoying pole, or "But, you know," like the whining George, or "I'm not in the mood," like the unenthusiastic John, or "I don't know what to do," like the passive-aggressive Ringo, or "I'm so confused," like the passive Ringo, or "I can't do this," like the passive Ringo.
It's not like we hated each other so much that we would get into fights like that, but there was definitely an air of "Well, it's impossible for us to work together anymore," and it's interesting that the Beatles felt the same way. It's interesting that the legend of the Beatles' break-up, or whatever you want to call it
And even in such an atmosphere, when the performance begins, everyone is really overflowing with talent.
It's bad when the process of creating "that famous song" happens while we're both saying "What do you think of this little phrase?"
In particular, the moment when the title song "Get Buck" comes together is amazing
The casual humming that gradually turns into the "Zu cha♪Zu cha♪" song with lyrics is well captured.
It's amazing to be able to see the process of composing like this
Well, it's normal, but everyone is so fat that just watching the performance scenes makes me happy.
It seems like it's still episode 3 of 4, but so far it seems like the biggest reason for the Beatles' breakup was the environment around them rather than the Beatles themselves.
The four of them would complain about this and that as they started to compose songs, but when it came to the venue for the live performance, the producers and promoters would say things like, "The Beatles are the best in the world!" in the same kind of mood as if they were the Beatles themselves, and it was easy to see that they were out of touch with reality.
Well, documentaries are subject to the director's interpretation, so it's possible that Peter Jackson felt that way, but...
I wondered if that was the reason why there were so many scenes with Paul as the villain, since he was supervising the production.

I was a salesman, but I was so sick that I had to change jobs, but at the time, I was not good at initiating sales, but I thought that I would be very good at sales that were requested by customers, so I changed jobs to a different industry, and it was very easy to work.
I was told that if I can find something I'm good at or something I can do, it will make my life a little easier in the future.
← Of course, it's best to think about this after taking some time to rest and recover.
However, there are also daily life issues, so if there is a company association or industrial doctor, or someone to consult, it may be a good idea to consult them and see if there is some kind of system in place.
It would be great if even a little bit of life could be made easier.

Tornadoes occur frequently in the U.S., causing major damage due to the unseasonably warm weather and strong cold air (Weather News) - Yahoo!News
From the night of the 10th (Saturday) to the 11th (Sunday) local time, there were many tornadoes in the southern United States.
At a time of record warmth for the period, the arrival of a strong cold front caused the atmosphere to become extremely unstable, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed.
Warm air from the southwest flowed into the southern United States, resulting in record high temperatures.
In Houston, Texas, the maximum temperature on Wednesday (9th) and Thursday (10th) is expected to rise to nearly 30°C.
This record-breaking warmth was followed by a sudden drop in temperature to below -30 degrees Celsius at an altitude of 5,500m, creating a large temperature difference that formed an active front, and cumulonimbus clouds rapidly developed along the front.
Tornadoes are believed to have occurred one after another in the surrounding area.
Southern America is an area prone to tornadoes, but the high season is from early summer to summer, and there are few cases of major damage during this period.
The number of tornado warnings issued in a single day during the winter was close to 150, a record number.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, there were more than 400 reports of tornadoes and gusts of wind on the 10th (Saturday) local time.
According to this, there are two concentrated areas, one on the southern line from Kentucky to Texas, and one on the northern line including Illinois.
In Kentucky, the strength of the tornado was indicated by the EF scale (modified Fujita scale), reaching EF3, which is the third strongest of the six stages, and it is believed that a gust of wind of around 70m/s was blowing for a moment.
In future investigations, it may be determined to be an EF4 or EF5.
In Japan, the JEF (Japanese Version of the Modified Fujita Scale) is used, which is based on the Modified Fujita scale, but modified to suit the situation of buildings in Japan.
The JEF3, which is equivalent to the American tornado, is also likely to occur in Japan, and could cause wooden houses to collapse.

Record-breaking Rice Cone Tornado Buried Under Debris, Live Broadcasts Cries for Help (Sports Daily) - Yahoo!News
Regarding the damage caused by the tornado in the Midwest and South of the United States, President Biden stated on the 11th (Japan time on the 12th), "One of the largest tornadoes in US history," with a solemn expression.
This was reported by CNN television.
Biden stressed, "As the federal government, we will do everything we can."
"We still don't know the full extent of the damage, such as how many lives were lost," he explained.
More than 100 people are feared dead.
Photo: In Kentucky, which was hit by the tornado, residents carrying household items from their destroyed homes from the night of the 10th to the morning of the 11th, when at least 30 tornadoes occurred in at least 6 states, including Kentucky.
As far as the area affected by the tornado is concerned, the record is 219 miles (about 350 kilometers) in 1925 in the state of Missouri, but CNN's meteorologist estimated that this time it was the largest at about 250 miles (about 400 kilometers).
In Mayfield, Kentucky, where the damage was particularly severe, the candle factory, which was operating 24 hours a day in preparation for the Christmas rush, was also severely damaged.
At the time, 110 people were working there, but the building was destroyed and disappeared without a trace.
The woman, who was unable to move under the rubble, about 1.5 meters thick, in the dark, felt the weight of the rescuers searching on top of the rubble and asked for help on Facebook Live from her smartphone.
In addition to the woman's screams for help, the live broadcast also included the sound of wails and the singing of "Happy Birthday to You" by another woman, presumably to distract from the horror.
Ms. Amber Brown, a convenience store clerk who lives in Mayfield, hid in the basement of her home with her 5-year-old son because of the tornado warning, and they were safe.
"Many people likened it to the sound of a train, but it was more like a terrifying sound like something spitting out," he recalled.
"The search will continue until it is no longer necessary," said a police officer from the Mayfield City Police.
I don't know how many weeks, months, or years it will take, but I will continue to do my best to help."
In Illinois, part of a warehouse belonging to online retail giant Amazon collapsed, killing at least six people.
Trains have derailed due to the impact of being separated from their carriages, and highways have been closed one after another due to the impact of vehicles rolling over.
According to Mi Web Media, approximately 400,000 homes, including 130,000 in Tennessee, were without power.

It's a harsh life of protection...
I'm praying that something can be done.
If there were "residential jobs" such as working at a hotel or resort, it would be possible to secure both a place to live and a source of income, but in the current social situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, there seem to be few options.
It seems like there should be a site like this, but...

What does it mean to be a specialist in gynecology?
A "specialist doctor" is a doctor who graduated 3 to 5 years ago.
They are also called "specialist physicians" and "advanced trainee physicians".
The so-called "resident physician" refers to the "initial resident physician", which refers to doctors who graduated 1 to 2 years ago.
It's true that they're inexperienced, but by the time they're in their fourth or fifth year, they'll be able to do some level of diagnosis, so they're given a variety of jobs.

There is an old saying that different people have different ideas about the star system of evaluation.
While other countries use five stars as the benchmark and deduct points from there, Japan uses three stars as the neutral point and adds/subtracts points from there.
At the benchmark point, there is already a difference of two stars, and four stars means "not a masterpiece, but a good work" in a completely different sense.
If you base it on five stars, then "works with no flaws" and "works of the highest standard in all respects" will be on the same level, so if there is such a tendency, then that would be a systematic flaw that does not indicate the meaning of stars, but since such a system is actually being used in such a way, I think it would be better to not put three stars (poor) on it.
So if you try to argue with people who advocate this kind of opinion using Steam's two-choice rating system, it won't make sense.

Lunch: "Fresh fish fried and shrimp fried caught near the coast, homemade tartar sauce"
"Hakobune" is a takeout shop specializing in colorful lunchboxes made with a variety of vegetables.
Last August, the restaurant was opened by the couple, Kaetsuki Katsuyuki (39) and Yumi (38), so that people can enjoy a restaurant-like atmosphere at home.
One of the most popular items on the lunch menu is "Local fish fried and shrimp fried with homemade tartar sauce" (1,000 yen).
Fish choose what they want at the market at the time.
"The fried shrimp is made with as little bread flour as possible so that you can taste the texture of the ingredients" (Takayuki), and the fried shrimp has a crispy texture that is immediately apparent.
The lunch includes four types of side vegetables and delicacies, as well as a rice dish with a variety of grains mixed with Hinohikari rice from Saga Prefecture, and soup.
The vegetables are homemade from the noodle farmer's own fields, and purchased from the prefecture's direct sales centers.
The side dishes change depending on the season, but Takayuki has been practicing French cuisine and adds color with ratatouille and ratatouille.
On the one hand, it is a fusion of Japanese and Western cuisine that appeals to a wide range of generations, like a "comforting flavor you're used to" (Yumi).
The lunchbox "Japanese beef handmade hamburger" (1,000 yen) is also popular.
Starting next year, they will also be selling "Charcuterie Sets" which are processed meats that go well with wine, such as wine.

There was something interesting at Haneda Airport, so I decided to give it a try.
It's not uncomfortable to ride, but it does shake a little (not enough to make you drunk).
Of course, it's slow.
Safety There were people around, so I slowed down, and in some cases stopped completely, so I thought it was safe, but in some places I thought it was dangerous.
It hurts to be looked at, but it's good to be looked at, but it feels like "I'm in the way," and it hurts my heart.
Overall, it wasn't bad, but there was still room for improvement.
It's a shame that it's not more user-friendly if there are fewer people, or if you can sit at the end.
Specifically, I thought it would be good to create a dedicated lane so as not to interfere with other pedestrians.
However, it's also nice and leisurely, so you can enjoy the scenery at a leisurely pace, so it's a great way to travel if there are fewer people.
In the near future, this kind of self-driving will become the mainstream, and it's exciting to think about the excitement of the near future and the pain of the surrounding gaze, and it's a difficult vehicle for someone who doesn't have a strong heart.
It was so embarrassing.

If you take a good look, you might be able to figure it out a little bit, but the eel is not used at all.
Actually, it's "Nasu!" (Tap it to see the answer)
I like eel, but in reality, everyone is just eating the tare, and the eel part is actually fine as long as it's cooked, I thought, but then I realized that the texture and amount of eel are important.
I don't want the eel to become extinct, but I just wanted to eat eel.

One man stabbed and fled on a motorbike: Attempted murder in Okai, Saga, on the 12th | Incidents and accidents | Saga Shimbun News | Saga Shimbun LiVE
At around 1:25pm on the 12th, a man in his 40s from Fukuoka prefecture was stabbed with a knife by a man in his 30s to 40s on the road in Dazai 1-chome, Saga city, sustaining injuries to his face.
The man fled on a motorcycle, and the Saga Minami Police Station is currently searching for him in connection with the attempted murder.

The man who escaped had a medium build and a skinhead haircut.
A knife believed to have been used in the attack was left near the scene.
The man said he had been drinking with several people, and police are investigating whether there was some kind of traffic accident between the pedestrian and the motorcyclist.

The Long Journey of a Family that has Taken Root in Environmental Protection Activities on the China Border (JBpress) - Yahoo!News
(Kato Yuki: Hong Kong-based business consulting firm Find Asia) China, which has a vast land area, is also important in terms of biodiversity, with the world's largest number of mammals and the world's third largest number of plant species.
Some local governments recognize the value of biodiversity, and are not only promoting environmental protection by local governments, but are also promoting the activities of environmental activists.
Xishuangbanna (Xishuangbanna), located in the southwest of China, is one such area.
Sister Li Wan Tan is currently active as an actress, and Xi Sa Pa Na is an area that borders both Laos and Myanmar, and is home to many ethnic minorities, including the "Tai" people, who share roots with the Thai people of the Kingdom of Thailand.
The source of the Mekong River, which flows through Southeast Asian countries, is located here.
Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture Xishuangbanna covers just 0.2% of China's total land area, but is home to about 25% of the country's wild animal species and 20% of its plant species.
This time, I was able to meet Lee Min-goo, who is carrying out environmental protection activities at Sea Sapanna, and hear about the details of her activities.
■ Started environmental activities with my German husband -- I have been involved in environmental activities for 20 years.
What was the catalyst for this?
Mr. Lee, our environmental protection activities "Tenji" started in 2000.
It all started with my husband, Josef Margraf.
Her husband is German and came to Xishuangbanna for a joint scientific project between the United Nations and China.
It is the only tropical rainforest in China, and boasts a wealth of biodiversity.
However, on the other hand, economic development has been slow.
For this reason, large-scale deforestation of the rainforest occurred in the past in order to establish industries in the area and to produce rubber, which was in short supply in China.
Her husband was sent here from Germany to research natural resource recovery and biological resources.
And it was here that I met my husband, who was a reporter.
-- Before that, did Mr. Lee not have an interest in nature conservation?
Mr. Lee I was born in Sisapanna, but I had no interest in the importance of tropical rainforests or the meaning of biodiversity.
As a result, she had to move forward with the project without knowing anything about it.
I sometimes see people with an aura who are not particularly handsome or tall, so why do you think that is?

It just occurred to me, but is it fine to say things like, "I like your outfit" or "I like your color"?

I can see it.
I don't think it's that detailed.
I've never been praised for being meticulous, so I'm not sure what it means.
I heard he praised you in detail.
What would you do if Yokoe Sakura confessed to you?
"Having been confessed to by Sakura-san, my heart is in full bloom, so I'm the one who should ask you out."
And in order to get along, I want to increase my knowledge of golf and share things we both like.
I would like to open a Rakuten Securities account, but if I choose not to open an NISA account now, will I be able to open it later?

[Omawa/Personal Memo] It took about a month and a half to identify the cause of the CTD in the MOD environment.
Multiple CTDs have occurred due to a variety of factors since stable data has not been available since the beginning of March, and it has taken a great deal of time to identify them, as there has not been much time to investigate them on days off.
Why didn't you use the.Net Script Framework to analyze the logs (it would have been obvious in a few minutes)? Some of the errors in the.dll series and mesh-related errors are not recorded in the crash logs.
Main CTD timing
* All papyrus and.Net Script Framework, log-leaving type.dll plug-ins leave no trace.
* When an NPC is killed/attacked, the Essentials be Gone (SKSE plugin/powerofthree's SE update reopened version) OFF improves even when the console kill is activated ※ Is there a possibility of wet clothes?
* When a kill move is activated against an NPC, the camera work is improved by turning off the PC-based kill move setting via the.ini file: This is a basic improvement, but the upper limit is not set, and the number of DAR animations is not even 10,000
* (Basic outdoors) Moving in the field + activating some spells (e.g. Frost Ring) and hitting NPCs: Using the NPC application settings (top right of MCM) in Dirt & Blood v2.0 with SPID turned off for 5 consecutive tests, all improved.
Is it because of a mistake in the shader settings for additional armor and body meshes used by an actor/NPC? Furthermore, the default.ini file for SPID use in 2.0 has a formatting error, but the result is the intended result, and NPCs should have the perk applied.
At first, I focused on checking the motion/combat mods (those with a.dll extension) that attack specific parts of the body and those related to OnHit, but the result turned out like this.
I don't think there were any similar bug reports in English, German, or French.
If there are people in a Japanese-speaking environment who have the same CTD problem, I thought it might be useful as a reminder, so I asked them to post it.
Everyone was on the edge of their mental limits,
No one around him notices, not even his colleagues or family.
Looking around, you can't help but think optimistically, "He looks like he's in a lot of pain, but he's doing a great job."
However, it is likely that he too is on the verge of a mental breakdown.
I haven't quit my job in the name of mental health, but I think I was at my limit just before I quit.
Thoughts on the importance of psychiatric visiting nurses - Today's visiting nurses have ended
I have bipolar disorder and have been receiving home care for a long time, but the nurse (female) at the home care station I am currently using has been with me for a long time and I think we have a very good relationship.
We talk about all sorts of things every week.
Of course, they will do what is necessary for medication management (such as one-bag-at-a-time), but above all, today's visiting nurses made me realize how important it is for people with mental illnesses to have enjoyable communication.
Today, there was a lot of discussion about gender theory and the differences between men and women.
They also talk about things like men's and women's sexual desires, or why she got divorced, things like that.
Occasionally, I've also dressed up as a woman.
However, I have heard from a friend that in the case of visiting nursing stations run by psychiatric hospitals, nurses who can no longer work in the wards come to provide only administrative support, or that occupational therapists come to provide visiting nursing care, but are told, "We are providing medical care here," from a superior's perspective.
I use a small visiting nursing station run by a social welfare foundation, and Frank is a really good nurse who treats me as an equal despite my mental illness.
By the way, she's beautiful.
There are people who are receiving psychiatric visits, and there are people who are considering receiving them.
Home visits are very helpful for people with mental illness.
If the doctor says it's okay, I'll definitely take it.
And choose a good visiting nursing station.
In the past, there were times when I just couldn't get along with them, so I broke off the contract.
I'm sorry.
I knew it was a false alarm, but I was scared when it came out in English.
Why does it come out in English?
There are several possible reasons, but for example...
I don't know what it says in Japanese
• Bug in language detection
• Browser settings are set to English first
The odd-numbered rankings are all based on the number of times a number has been drawn in the lottery.

It repeats or continues.
I've been telecommuting due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
But I can't concentrate on work at home.

South Korea's hydrogen technology patents are 1/5 of China's... "Behind schedule in implementing the hydrogen economy roadmap" (Chosun Ilbo Japanese edition) - Yahoo!News
In 2019, the Korean government released a hydrogen economic roadmap.
By 2022, it aims to have 65,000 fuel cell vehicles in circulation (cumulative), and to operate 310 hydrogen stations across the country.
The target price was set at 6,000 won (approximately 577 yen) per kilogram.
However, as of November 2018, fuel cell vehicles accounted for only 27% of the target (about 17,000 vehicles).
The target for the number of hydrogen stations in core infrastructure is 38% (about 117 locations), and the price of hydrogen per kilometer is about 8,400 won, which is not much different from when the roadmap was announced.
It has been revealed that the government's hydrogen economy roadmap is not meeting its targets.
On the 12th, the All-Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (All Nippon Keizai Renmei) released a report titled "Current Status and Policy Direction of the Hydrogen Economic Ecosystem".
According to the report, the core parts and materials of the hydrogen industry are almost entirely dependent on the United States and Japan.
Carbon fiber, a core material for fuel cell vehicles, is supplied by Toray (Japan), platinum catalysts by Kyocera (Japan), membranes by Dupont (US), Goar (US), and 3M (US).
The number of hydrogen technology patents held by the six countries that dominate the global hydrogen market (China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, and Germany) has been increasing at an average annual rate of 14% (since 2014).
In terms of the number of patents for hydrogen production and fuel cell technology (2014-2020), South Korea ranks fifth in the world.
However, the Federation of Japanese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FJCCI) said, "In fact, six countries account for the majority of the world's hydrogen market, which means that they are actually at the bottom of the list of competing countries."
The country rankings are China, the US, the EU, and Japan.
Since 2017, when China surpassed the US to become number one, the gap has been widening.
In 2020, the number of patents registered in Korea was 1,033, surpassing Japan (974) and ranking fourth, but it was only 22% of the number registered in China (4,721).
The All Japan Federation of Electric Power Companies proposed that "hydrogen technology should be designated as a 'national strategic technology' because of the large amount of tax deductions for equipment investment and research and development costs."

Is it a crime for a store to sell something for more than its listed price?
Today, the PS5 sold for 70,000 yen at the store.
It's appropriate.
Since there is free competition, for example, if a branded item increases in scarcity value from its regular price
For example, if a painter becomes famous and the price goes up, this is considered appropriate
The fact that PS5 is selling at a high price is due to its rarity value, and the value is only higher than the set price.

Creation of TV-style flyers in Takasu, Hokkaido: Hokkaido Shimbun Doshin Digital Edition
The town council of Takasu is working on unique council reforms, such as creating a unique flyer to introduce the regular council meetings, and introducing a "contact book" where citizens can rate councilors.
Town council elections have been held without a vote for three consecutive terms, and the aim is to gain the interest of townspeople.
On the 9th, about 1,800 new flyers were distributed in newspaper inserts in order to inform people about the Sunday session on the 12th.
"Freshly Caught Sashimi" "Tetsuko's Room" "Sawaguchi Hitoshi Exploration Series"...
The flyer distributed to all households by the town council on the 9th is full of phrases reminiscent of popular TV shows.

Rice and aid weapons ammunition arrive in Ukraine, to be used for training (CNN.co.jp) - Yahoo!News
(CNN) U.S. State Department officials reported that equipment including small arms and ammunition arrived in Ukraine by the 12th, based on the security assistance plan approved by President Biden.
The total amount of military aid is equivalent to 60 million dollars (approximately 6.8 billion yen), and by the end of the year, the last equipment, including four radars to determine the location of mortars, will be shipped to Ukraine.
According to Carney, a spokesman for the US Department of Defense, these aid packages included lethal weapons such as the Javelin anti-tank missile.
The purpose of the military support is to strengthen Ukraine's defense capability in response to Russia's troop reinforcements around the Ukrainian border.
The US has become increasingly wary of Russian military movements, and is also consulting with NATO allies to prepare a response in the event that Russia decides to invade Ukraine.
President Biden approved arms assistance when Ukrainian President Zelensky visited the White House on September 1st of this year.
Military support from the United States to Ukraine this year has reached approximately 450 million dollars.
The total amount of aid since Russia's forced annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula has exceeded $2.5 billion.
The US military is also carrying out training missions for the Ukrainian military.
In the previous month, the Florida National Guard was sent to Ukraine as part of a multinational joint training program in support of Ukraine.
According to a statement from the US Department of Defense, the US Special Operations Command in Europe has also played a major role in training and advising Ukraine's special forces.
The number of US special forces operating in Ukraine is classified as a matter of operational secrecy.
President Biden held an online meeting with Russian President Putin on the 7th of this month, but they also had a tense exchange over the situation in Ukraine.
The US has also shown that it will impose severe economic sanctions in the event of an invasion.

The Future of the "Review" of the Inheritance and Gift Tax, Which Makes "Forbidden Hands" of Living Wills, Aimed at Akira Amari, Former Chairman of the LDP Tax Investigation Committee
The first special feature in the December 18th issue of Weekly Diamond is "Talk to your family at the end of the year!
"Living Wills and Advance Directives."
As the debate over the integration of the inheritance tax and gift tax continues, the 2022 tax reform guidelines, which have been postponed, are likely to make the "forbidden move" of lifetime gifts, which is the best way to deal with the inheritance tax in the near future.
How will inheritance rules change?
Along with a direct hit on the former tax committee chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party and House of Representatives member Akira Amari, he taught everything from the basics of gift and inheritance to tax-saving techniques that can be done before the end of the year.
(Diamond Editorial Department, Miyahara Keisho)
"Lifetime gifts are a 'forbidden move' from asset owners to company employees in urban areas," he said, adding, "From the perspective of imposing inheritance and gift taxes in a more integrated manner, we will move forward with a full-scale examination of building a tax system that is neutral when it comes to choosing the timing of asset transfers."
The announcement, made by the party last year, of the outline of tax reforms for the 2021 fiscal year caused a great stir among not only the wealthy, but also the middle class.
This is because what they are trying to say is that by changing the rules of inheritance and making "living wills" a "forbidden move" that is the best way to avoid inheritance tax, which would result in a huge increase in inheritance tax.
The rule of thumb for tax-saving strategies for the progressive inheritance tax is to "reduce the property subject to taxation."
This strongest trump card of lifetime gifts has been widely used, not only by asset holders, but also by company employees who have homes in the three major metropolitan areas, even if the inheritance tax is small.
In the midst of this, there has been a surge of debate on the "integration of inheritance and gift taxes."
The outline of the tax reform for the fiscal year 2022, which was announced on December 10 and had been feared to be the slowest to be introduced, was postponed, but it was reiterated that "the current system of calculating and taxing inheritance and the calendar year gift system should be reconsidered," and that "the non-taxation measures for gift taxes are a system that does not impose any tax burden on the transfer of assets within the family, within a certain limit," and that "they will continue to be reconsidered."
Former Chairman of the LDP Tax Investigation Committee and former Chairman of the LDP, Akira Amari, said in an interview with this editorial department.
"It's most important to make the tax burden the same no matter when you move.
At the moment, we are simulating what problems will arise as a result of the integration. "If the amendment is passed as quickly as possible, there will be three opportunities left for lifetime gifts.
Even if it doesn't happen in the near future, it seems likely that the government will make a big move to invalidate lifetime gifts as a tax avoidance measure.
So, how exactly will the rules for inheritance tax and gift tax change?

It has been decided that the FOD original drama "My Perfect Brother" starring Yuta Kogawa will be broadcast on terrestrial television on Fuji TV from late at night on January 10, 2022.
Photo: The heroine, Hanayo, played by Hanayo Kaori, is the protagonist of a manga of the same name serialized in Kodansha's "BE·LOVE" since 2018, based on a story of pure love between a man and a woman burdened by the past.
The protagonist, Haley, is played by Furukawa, and the heroine, Rise, is played by Yamanaka.
Risa, a college student, meets her senior at her part-time job, Haley.
Hailey, who is plagued by insomnia, is a mysterious young man who, for some reason, is able to fall asleep soundly on Rise's shoulder.
Riko is attracted to Haley, who has a similar air to her brother, who was estranged from her parents, but Haley is a murderer?
• Komagawa Yuta comments The drama "My Perfect Brother" will be broadcast on terrestrial TV from January 10th!
For those who couldn't see it on FOD, please look forward to it, and for those who have already seen it, knowing the plot, you can see Hayley and Rise's complex psychological portrayal, and see how they struggle and change, which will allow you to know the work even better.
I'm happy that fans of the original will also enjoy it.
Please look forward to it!

[NFL] Team that won with 3 passes in 1 game, what did the players feel (BBM Sports) - Yahoo!News
Jones' pass in this game - the Patriots only threw three passes.
This is the fewest number of passes in the past 50 years in the NFL since the Bills recorded two passes against the New York Jets in the third week of 1974.
In 1974, the Bills had O.J. Simpson, a once-in-a-generation running back who had become the first player in history to exceed 2,000 yards in a season the previous year.
The Bills dominated the Jets with Simpson and another RB, Jim Braxton.
The biggest reason for the Patriots' extreme offense this time was the weather.
Buffalo is a town close to the Canadian border, and is the same latitude as Kushiro in Hokkaido.
On this day, the temperature was around 1 degree Celsius, and the wind was blowing at 18 meters per second, and there was blowing snow before the match.
As a local, Bills didn't change his play selection much.
There were 30 passes compared to 25 runs.
Allen's pass was 15/30, 145 yards.
There was no interception, and he was by no means ineffective.
In the 10th inning of the offensive series, the Red Zone intrusion was 4 times, and there were scoring opportunities.
Particularly in the third quarter, they advanced to the red zone three times in a row.
However, they were only able to score 3 runs in the 3rd inning.
The final goal of the match.
The Bills, trailing 4-0, committed a penalty on 3rd and 9, making it 3rd and 14.
It's 18 yards to the goal.
On 3rd and 14, QB Allen was surrounded by a rush from the Patriots defense, and the ball came out of his pocket and floated right.
He then tried to throw a pass to End Zone TE Doss, but failed.
In this play, Ace WR Stefon Diggs was running down the right sideline in the end zone and was wide open, but Allen didn't seem to see him.
On 4th and 18, Allen targeted WR Gabriel Davis from the left sideline in the end zone, but the pass was intercepted by Patriots DB Mills Bryant.
Bryant was man-to-man covering Bill's WR Cole Beasley, but saw Allen's movement and released Beasley, reacting to the pass.
Allen, who overlooked the two receivers, threw the pass aiming for the end zone on both occasions.
The 4th down pass may have been a desperation play, but the 3rd down, there was no need to target a touchdown.
It would be enough to get a first down on two plays.
It was still two minutes before the end of the half, so if they had gone for fourth and short, Allen's ability to run the ball would have been put to use.

It's time to throw out and replace 3 items that are often left in the kitchen for a long time (Harper's Bazaar) - Yahoo!News
Sponges
No matter how frequently they are changed, sponges are probably not being changed as frequently as recommended.
According to a 2017 study, even if kitchen sponges are sterilized in the microwave every day, bacteria continue to proliferate (though it is still recommended to sterilize them in the microwave).
The German researcher who conducted this study recommends changing the sponge once a week to keep it clean.
Mana board
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pointed out that the treads will begin to wear out, and if there are any cuts or grooves, the treads should be replaced.
Once a wound or crease develops, it becomes difficult to keep it clean, and bacteria multiply.
If you are still fine, do not forget to frequently disinfect with a solution of one tablespoon of unscented liquid bleach dissolved in one gallon (about 3.8 liters) of water.
Immerse the surface of the plank in the liquid and leave for a few minutes.
Rinse with clean water and let it air dry, or pat it dry with a clean paper towel.
Broken or chipped dishes
It may be painful to get rid of your favorite mug, but the missing surface will become a new breeding ground for bacteria and bacteria.
In addition, it can cause cuts on the lips or spill drinks due to the missing parts.
That's right, a chance to buy a new favorite mug!

Help! FlashBIOS won't stop
I bought the Ryzen 7 5800X, so I replaced the B550 and Tomahawk I bought in September.
At one point, I went as far as the BIOS setup screen, but when I saved the settings and rebooted, the screen stayed black with a white cursor-like dot blinking, and nothing happened.
Thinking that the BIOS was damaged, I tried to replace it using FlashBIOS, but it didn't work at all.
According to MSI's blog, it only takes about 5 minutes, but it doesn't end in an hour
It could be because the USB memory I tried was too old, or because I was using an SD card instead.

I think it's best to choose a height that suits you.
In Japan, for example, I think it's good.
In Japan,...
It has nothing to do with gaijin style.
It's better to say it early, "Why am I the only one you call by my first name? / You're so rude."
So because they're foreigners, it doesn't matter? It's better to simply say that it's unpleasant.
I don't think it's likely that you're thinking of me with disgust.
I lived overseas for a while, but the Japanese who went out there, including me, didn't like the hierarchical Confucian customs, and there were quite a few people who didn't like it and lost their sense of propriety, and they thought they could say anything to the locals.
If it's visible to Europeans, it's not out of pure malice, but rather a kind of spoiled or easy-going attitude.
If my friends were from Europe or America, I'd call them by their first names, but when I'm speaking in Japanese, there are times when I wonder which to use.
Well, it's fine if it's a friend, but...
It's just that he's doing it in a normal way, but if you look at it, he's a gaijin, so maybe it's better to say it now before it gets out of hand.
I was told that because it's Japan, please talk in Japanese
Henshuu: It doesn't matter, but my white friend who naturalized always raises his glass higher than the others when we toast.
I'm certainly aware of it, but I think it's a good habit to have, because if you do it, you won't be made fun of by younger or older people.
Japanese people, regardless of their personality, are people who pay attention to such small details (including me), so it's shitty.

Thank you to our 50 subscribers!
When I opened reddit today, I saw that this subreddit, which I had just created, had more than 50 subscribers.
I'm so happy.
Thank you to everyone who subscribed!
Actually, as of yesterday, the number of subscribers was 25, so I thought it would take a little longer to reach 50, but for some reason, 25 subscribed today, so I'm really grateful.
It would be great if anyone who bought this supplement today could tell us in the comments section where they heard about it! (I'm really curious, but I don't have a clue.)
Now that I'm the only one posting in the thread, I'd be grateful if you could also post in the thread.
It would be an encouragement even if you don't post comments.
Maybe reddit is used, but there are few people who use twitter.
If you're using Twitter, please be sure to leave a comment!
Last but not least, thank you so much! The last time I made a sub-league, it didn't go as well as I'd hoped, and people didn't come together as I'd hoped, but this time, thanks to all of you, it looks like we'll be able to continue without any setbacks.

I only know a little bit of English, so I can only judge from the translated text.
The translated text feels a little awkward to read, but I can understand what it's trying to say, and I don't think it's a problem to play, so I think it's at a level where it's fine to play (I only feel this way, so I think it's best to ask other people what they think)
This level of translation is common in games produced overseas, and if it's a small company, it feels like it's been translated well.
I don't think someone who is not a native Japanese speaker can understand the subtle nuances of the language even if they study for a long time.
I don't know what level you're looking for, but if you're looking for a level where Japanese people don't feel out of place, I think you should look elsewhere.

Training is the battle in "Demon Slayer."
"The Equal Exchange of Effort" is a paean to humanity <Anime "Yukuhaku Hen" Begins> (QJWeb Quick Japan Web) - Yahoo!News
Among recent shonen manga, Demon Slayer is particularly different in that it has a lot of training.
As a general rule, readers don't like to read chapters that don't have battles, whether it's day or night.
It's the same in the One Piece manga, where the Straw Hat Pirates were separated for two years while they trained, but it's clear from the fact that they only drew the outline and left the rest to the imagination.
Well, one-piece swimsuits are one of the charms of the exuberance of the land you're walking through, but "staying in the same place and practicing" doesn't always go well together.
The protagonist of "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba," Goboro, began his training by kneeling down in front of Fuko Yoshiyasu, who saved his life, and begging him to spare the life of Nezuko, who tried to take his own life.
The weak have no rights or options, they are simply overpowered by the strong.
While saying this, it was Yoshiyuki's kindness that introduced the "Uketsu" scaled waterfall left next, who was training the applicants to join the Kishigatani.
Kojiro's first contact with Kagamidaira was when he was asked, "What will you do when your sister eats a person?" Kojiro was stumped for an answer and was given a slap on the hand for being slow to respond.
Even among fans, it's an exchange that seems unreasonable at first glance.
However, walking around with a demonic sister may bring about the possibility of being forced to make such a decision.
It could be said to be an initiation into the practice from the outset.
However, Scallop Waterfall takes the still untrained amateur, Tanjiro, and tells him to climb down to the foot of the mountain by sunrise.
On top of the thin air, the mountains are littered with pits, catapults, and traps, and you'll probably die before you even start your training.
Despite this, his keen sense of smell allows him to detect the faint scent of a trap set by human hands, and he manages to avoid it just barely, becoming the "Hero Correction."
Even so, "Just because that's the case, it doesn't mean that all of a sudden my physical abilities have improved to the point where I can dodge all of that!" is what Tanjiro would say, and that's the essence of making the Demon Slayer a Demon Slayer.
Ordinary people don't suddenly become strong without any training, and becoming enlightened just means they can use the power and skills they've honed to this point to their full potential.
For those who put in the effort, they will be rewarded, but for those who don't put in the effort, they will not be rewarded. This "equivalent exchange of effort" is not the same as the supernatural power of a ghost, but rather a human anthem, and it is the unshakable rule of the series.

South Korea's Samsung Electronics creates new "DX Division" to integrate home appliances and mobile devices, "emphasizing user experience" (WoW!Korea) - Yahoo!News
It was announced on the 12th that Samsung Electronics has decided to unify its CE and IM divisions into a single department called DX (Device eXperience), which will be reflected in the organizational restructuring at the end of the year.
Through a variety of services, from mobile to home appliances, the intention is to enhance the user experience.
Samsung Electronics has revealed that the DX division, which was newly established by merging the CE and IM divisions, will be made up of the VD (Visual Display), home appliances, medical equipment, MX (Mobile eXperience), and network business divisions.
A Samsung Electronics official explained, "This name change reflects our long-term business structure, our vision for the future, and our desire to strengthen global leadership."
He also stressed that it is not only products such as TVs, home appliances, smartphones, and communications equipment, but also service solutions that reflect customer needs, that will enable consumers to enjoy an optimized experience.
The name also reflects the company's strategy of creating synergies and differentiated products and services on a corporate-wide scale, using the launch of the integrated leadership system as an opportunity to transcend organizational boundaries.
Samsung Electronics has already conceived a strategy through the "Multi Device Experience (MDE) Council" to make it possible for users to freely use content and services by linking devices such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) based home appliances and smartphones.

While it's a matter of personal preference, I don't think the "desu/masu style" suits natural science documentaries narrated by men with low voices.
I'd like it to be heavier and more serious.
> They lie in wait, jaws primed, only their armored heads visible from the sand... any creature that stumbles into their pit will be speared and dragged below.
> Humbug caterpillars lie in wait in the sand to catch prey at any time, only showing their disc-shaped heads from the sand.
This is a little unnatural.
Hantemirov's larvae lie in wait in the sand, ready to catch prey at any time, with only their disc-shaped heads peeking out of the sand.
That's what I think.
What worries me is
* Did you use other documentaries as a reference?
* Are you seeing it from the ant's perspective?
Right?
If you translate "armoured heads" as a disc-shaped head, "it's a giant creature wearing a helmet in the scale of an ant" disappears, doesn't it?
Trailer driver involved in Aichi 24 incident has no pre-existing conditions, was it negligence? (ANN) - Yahoo!News
In the case of the 24-vehicle collision in Komaki City, Aichi Prefecture, the driver of the trailer, who was arrested and indicted, has no pre-existing medical conditions, and it is believed that the accident was caused by some kind of carelessness.
On the morning of the 10th, 24 trucks and passenger cars collided on National Route 41 in Komaki City, leaving 12 people with minor injuries.
The police arrested suspect Nomura Katsuya (54), who was driving the trailer, on suspicion of causing a collision that injured a 71-year-old man, and indicted him on the morning of the 12th.
After the accident, Nomura's trailer continued to move without braking, and firefighters also confirmed that Nomura lost consciousness shortly after the accident.
However, according to investigators, the suspect, Nomura, did not have any pre-existing medical conditions, and it is believed that some form of carelessness was the cause.
The police are conducting a house search of the relevant parties and are investigating the situation in detail.

Oginu ma X's review of King Meat Man [Comic Book Volume 4] (Shu Pure NEWS) - Yahoo!News
The 20th Superman Olympics, which began in volume 3, comes to an end in this volume!
In contrast to the first volume, which covers the opening to the semi-finals in one go, this volume focuses on just one match, and is full of new tricks!
• "Kinnikuman" Volume 4 Review Submitted by Oginu ma X (5 out of 5 stars) • Super Pro Wrestling starts before the match!
In a nutshell, this fourth volume is a detailed and meticulous depiction of the final match between Kinnikuman and Robin Mask, but first and foremost, I would like to point out that this is not a volume that only depicts the match in the ring.
It starts with the warm-up drills, and then there's the sight of the two teams competing against each other and the special training drills, and it's a far cry from what it was before, but it's by no means boring.
The sense of tension that builds up as the century's greatest battle is about to begin is sure to heighten the reader's mood, and it's clear that even the timing of this period was carefully calculated.
And then there's the third place deciding match between Terryman and Ramenman, which is not to be missed before the big final.
Aside from its luxuriousness as a trading card, what I love about it is that before the match, behind the scenes, Ramen Man says to the poster of Kinnikuman, "From now on, I will be the one to aim for!!!"
And hit him with a chop.
However, Terryman, who just happened to be passing by, stopped him by catching his hand and staring at him in silence, and the scene ended with the two of them simply parting ways.
What's so great about this? Both of them have already been eliminated, so there's no way you'll get a chance to fight Kinnikuman in this tournament.
But there's a funny story about that Kinnikuman.
If I see this, I can't help but think about my future activities!
This is what it means to have a character that stands out, and it's a scene that still makes me feel it as a manga artist!
The fight between the two didn't end in a draw, but the highlight was the ramen man's tearful appeal after the match.
"Please don't rely on the strength of luck alone!"
That's the line.
This is a grandiose meta-commentary on the work itself, or rather, up until now, readers have thought that Kinnikuman is the protagonist, so he can't lose, and that he has somehow won in spite of his lack of ability.
However, by allowing Ramenman to make such a statement, Mr. Yudetamago has put himself in a position where he can no longer use that tactic.
With this one sentence, readers wondered, "Hey, is Kinnikuman actually going to beat Robin with his own strength?
How?
It's a development that's hard to predict, and if you look at it from a writer's perspective, it's a line that boils down to the author of the work, Ms. Yuimata, putting a leash on herself.
This is amazing.
This is definitely one of the big points of this volume.

Winter Illumination Weekend held at Aoba-yama, Takahama Town (Fukui Prefecture) (FBC Fukui Broadcasting) - Yahoo!News
The first ever winter illumination at Aoba-yama Harbour Village in Nakayama, Takahama-cho, began, and the park was enveloped in a gentle light.
(December 12th) The winter illumination, which began on November 26th, features 50,000 LED bulbs, including a 20m tall Cryptomeria tree, dotted around the promenade and lawns.
A visitor from Shiga Prefecture said, "I haven't been to Fukui in a while, and I was surprised to find a place like this.
It's so beautiful, and I'm so happy," she said.
The illumination was planned for the first time in order to avoid crowds while still providing a sense of healing, and will be lit from 5pm to 8:30pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays until December 25th.
On the final day of the 25th, there will also be a Christmas event with a button potluck and movie screening.

Agricultural Promotion Association of Yonezawa Broadcasts from Yonezawa to Promote Agricultural and Livestock Products on the Internet | Yamagata Shimbun
On the 11th, the Tozai Agricultural Promotion Council, which is made up of municipalities and towns in the Tozai area and the JA, launched a PR campaign for agricultural and livestock products using "live commerce," which is the distribution of videos on the internet while selling products.
For the first time, the Minato Market TV program, which was planned by Minato-ku, Tokyo, featured remote appearances by Yamagata Ai's samurai team, along with local specialty products, to convey the charm of the area.
Thanks to the "Okitama x Minato Opening Project", an initiative to collaborate between the Okitama and Minato wards, a stall was set up, and the event was relayed from the Urayama Vision House in Minaminohara, Yamagata.
Kuroda Mika, who is active as a "local sommelier," wears a stole from the brand "Nitorito" of rice weaving, and introduces the charm of the area surrounded by nature.
He also shared a photo of the potluck with the love warriors.
At the studio in Tokyo, comedian duo Tanpopo's Emiko Kawamura and YouTubers with more than 300,000 subscribers sampled local sake, wine, Yonezawa beef, and Tsuya Hime.
The deliciousness was conveyed to the viewers, and comments such as "I can smell the aroma even though it's streaming" and "There are so many delicious things in the alcohol, it's the best" flew around.

Today's misfortune...
The power supply for the PC in the NAS has died 🎉🎊🎉🎈🎉
~What happened~
1.) Open the window for ventilation.
The PC was on at the time.
2.) A little while later, when I returned to the room, I noticed a sound like a pink rotter coming from the PC, so I shut it down for the time being.
At this point, it was thought that the fan was just malfunctioning due to the drop in room temperature (6 degrees Celsius).
So I tried again after warming up the room.
3.) Do not start.
When the power button is pressed, the power light turns on and the fan turns on, but it stops immediately.
After that, they don't say anything.
I unplug the power cord and try it again, but it only works for a moment.
4.) Connecting only the motherboard and ATX20 pins, and removing all other parts, I tried it, but it wouldn't start.
5.) There have been times when it sounded like a fan of the PSU was hitting something, making a bu bu bu bu bu bu sound, so I wondered if the PSU was the cause.
I'll try it with an ATX power supply tomorrow.
Probably.
If that doesn't work, what should I do?
Change it with the case and the mother?
