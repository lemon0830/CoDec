From my point of view, the literature program was formed by Balzac-aged ladies on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the point of view of those same Balzac-age ladies.
And the psychology and torment of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev are not so interesting to teenagers.
Teenagers are generally not interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, it's very interesting.

Protection from dust and pollution is provided by a detachable jacket made of jacquard, supplied as part of the set.
Buy a pair of mattress with an orthopedic pillow - it is recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during sleep.

Andrei, they explained to you lucidly that pensioners work in schools, they won’t work in a team.
The computer teacher won’t be able to help either, he wasn’t taught how to do it, the school plays games on Windows.
So there is no support.
I remember these dinners and the guests at my parents' house with horror.
Guests are at the door, and the pancakes are still frying on the stove, and the mother is scrubbing the floor.
Lord, I already sat down at the table without strength.
And then there's still the dishes to do, the house to clean.
A week before the holiday, you haul in groceries, do two days of cleaning, and do a day of cleaning after.
And what about the guests?
It's good for them, and they always carry a tissue.
I haven't liked holidays or guests since then.
Even for my family, I'm setting the table to a minimum.
And I cook for them, I bake very often, just like that.
Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccination is inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine are likely to be enough for complete protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigelt, is convinced of this.
Die Welt reported this on Saturday, 11 December.
"We expect that the fourth vaccination will be required in the summer, at the latest in the fall," the expert believes.
Additionally, Weigelt hopes that a fourth dose of the coronavirus vaccine can be administered "in combination with a flu vaccine."
This will help achieve the best results.
In addition, enhanced vaccination can help in the fight against the spread of the new strain of coronavirus "Omicron".
And the new option is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, manufacturers BioNTech / Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
Companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times."
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron variant," BioNTech and Pfizer said.
Therefore, a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on speeding up vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society of Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favor of reducing the interval between the second and third vaccination.
Moreover, as Salzberger believes, accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience shows this very convincingly," the expert stressed.
Voblaer Pontoon21, Bet A Vib, 54 silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21 ®.
It (as well as the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created taking into account the use for ice fishing, and not just for catching bait.
These bikes have a higher specific weight than their close-to-size analogs, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting motorcycles.
Another recognizable feature is the top fin made of durable and resilient plastic, creating additional shades of vibration during vertical and horizontal runs.
As a "winter vibe", Bet-A-Vib plays a rather aggressive game when fishing.
Often, the simplest monotonous animation is the most effective, i.e. the movement of a jackhammer up and down with almost no pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, littered with underwater vegetation, ruts and other obstacles, for which it is possible to hook.
In addition, a small deviation is relevant when fishing for cod and large perch in the winter, and especially in the middle of winter, when an accurate and aggressive delivery of the bait is required.
Reaching the apex of its trajectory, the Bet-A-Vib instantly unfurls and returns to its original vertical position.
No less successfully, Bet-A-Vib is also used for winter trout fishing.
To please its caprices, you can choose from two modifications: with a noisy capsule (NS – NanoSound) or without it (SL – Silent).
It was also noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to separate a passive pike that doesn't even react to a live bait.
Bet-A-Vib demonstrates distance and accuracy when fishing for bait.
This weave is understandable and not capricious, well combined with the braid and braided ropes even large diameters.
For catching bream, pikeperch, roach, or perch, in addition to a uniform lure, a "step" is also useful, sometimes with "chirping" along the bottom.
If you're fishing in choppy waters, you can switch to a twin-hook setup, which will reduce the chance of hooking.
Among Bet-A-Vib's peers, it's one of the most durable and, as a result, one of the most nimble.
It can be used with equal success on both relatively shallow and quite deep sections.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young loafers are sitting on the necks of elderly parents.

7,000 Russian mercenaries were announced in Libya
There are more than 7,000 mercenaries from the private military company (PMC) Wagner in Libya.
This was announced on Sunday, 12 December, by the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic, Khaled al-Mishri.
"There are currently more than 7,000 mercenaries from the Wagner Group in Libya.
They also have planes.
They are also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 fighter jets at Gardabia air bases (which is also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)," Anadolu Agency quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that the Russian mercenaries “are trying to seize ” the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after they“ bring their man to power ” in the Central African Republic.
Keeping a presence
According to the publication's interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "settled in Libya".
"Wagner" has been in Libya since 2019, using the airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the airbase in Jufra, the publication notes.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner Group receives support from the Kremlin.
Where else are there mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner allegedly operates in nine African countries: the Central African Republic, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagners' subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technologies and military services to these countries, "the article says.
According to media reports, Wagnerians allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan, and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in the security agencies, nor in the registry of legal entities, and its fighters are absent from the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Recall, earlier the 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Vagner.
This decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions, dominated by Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the transfer of the single day of voting for the election of deputies of parliament and the head of state from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"Less than two weeks remain until the elections, and the chances of them taking place on time are rapidly decreasing," the article notes.
Against this backdrop, the High Electoral Commission of Libya postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period of time, Sky News Arabia reports.
Foreign policy through Russian eyes
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, while 29% believe that failures predominate.
“Examples of successes: ‘we defended and restored peace in Syria’, ‘we made a decision on Nord Stream 2’, ‘we scared the whole world with sharp weapons’, ‘we squeezed Crimea’.
The main failures are “the conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, and “isolation from the world”, according to a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paper case processing - all government services have also become digital only
The government of Dubai announced a complete rejection of paper-based document processing and a transition to digital technologies.
All government services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
“Today marked the start of a new phase of Dubai ’ s digital transformation across all aspects of life – we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government, ” Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai Executive Council, said in a statement on Saturday.
Now, internal and external document circulation in all state institutions of Dubai will be carried out only in digital form through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, the police, municipal authorities, courts, etc. Many commercial organisations also joined the government ’ s initiative.
The transition to e-government and digitization of document circulation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

These people knew exactly that there was someone at home...
Turkey's car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's figures for the first 11 months were worse than last year's result, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, 115,000 cars were produced in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year ago.
Approximately 75,900 vehicles were exported, which is more than 25% less than in the previous year.
And if, according to the results of the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed a positive trend compared to last year, then by the end of 11 months of 2021, car production was already 0.3% worse than last year's figure.
The reason for this fall was a sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received deferral of loan payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, Kazinform media correspondent reports.
"According to the Agency for the Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, pursuant to the instruction of the Head of State from April 1, 2021, Order No. 127 of the Chairman of the Agency of April 9, 2021 "On approval of the Procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans to small and medium-sized businesses" was adopted," Alihan Smailov wrote in his response to the deputy's inquiry.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans provided for banks and organizations engaged in microfinance to grant deferrals of payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including IP, from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The period of postponement was from 30 to 90 days, depending on the choice of the subject of the SBI.
The borrower could specify a different deferral period in the statement.
During the period of deferment, the borrower was suspended from collecting claims, notifying the borrower of the need to repay overdue debt, as well as collecting commissions and other payments from the creditor’, the deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, the banks of the second level received applications for deferral of payments on loans from 603 borrowers-subjects of SMEs, of which 553 SME subjects received deferral for the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SMEs have applied to the IFIs for deferment, of which 95 have been granted deferment in the amount of 105.8 million tenge", concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the omicron strain
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems may be able to tolerate it better than those with a strong body's defensive reaction
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev explained why the Omicron strain of coronavirus could be dangerous.
The reason lies in the conditions under which the virus was born.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected person or a person with immunodeficiency.
That is, with the mutation, he did not encounter any resistance from the immune system.
As a result, he is more aggressive.
Because there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, he has these spike proteins, needles, maybe more than is necessary, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, says pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity may be able to tolerate "Omicron" more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when 30-year-olds die and 60-year-olds cough it off.
The young man's immune response is ferocious, it's completely inappropriate: where it was only possible to threaten with a finger, he beats like a cannon at sparrows, Sergey Puryasev concluded.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Lung inflammation can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, it is often possible to treat only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of intoxication of the body - this is temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, throat irritation, coughing.
Pain on the right or left side, or abdominal pain, can also be a sign of a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, the younger generation from 12 to 18 years old may begin to be vaccinated before the end of the year.
Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the genome engineering laboratory at MIPT, noted that this category of people is very susceptible to COVID-19.
Teenagers who go to school have the most contact.
This is the most socially active layer, just like kindergarten students, Pavel Volchkov, a virologist and head of the genomic engineering laboratory at MIPT, told Moscow 24.

Immunologists put forward a hypothesis as to why people with obesity become victims of Covid-19
The authors of the work studied the fatty tissue left from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with coronavirus.
The immune cells located in the fat tissue, the macrophages, were also infected and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
The scientists also examined the fatty tissue of patients who died from Covid and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fatty tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid the immune response.
It is likely that SARS CoV-2 is also capable of this.
A biologist spoke about the causes of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Golosheykin named the causes of dementia and spoke about ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person has difficulty orienting even in a familiar environment.
Goloshekin noted that the most common causes of dementia are neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, certain infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive engagement may play a role," he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and a sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Earlier, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of the FGAOU VO RNIMU.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the department of cognitive disorders at the Federal Center for the Brain and Neurotechnologies Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30,000 illegally exported artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return home about 30 thousand artifacts that were illegally exported from the country by smuggling.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, on the television channel Al-Hayat by the chief inspector of the department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization have been discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Ghaouad clarified that all the artifacts smuggled out are registered in the archives.
Now the department's employees are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, the specialists "monitor auctions around the world and sales on the Internet" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that the cultural artifacts would be restored upon their return and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities turned to Interpol with a request to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4, at which the bust, which is more than 3,000 years old, was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction from Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally exported in the 1970s from the Temple of Karnak in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, has been kept in a private collection and has not been exhibited at auctions since 1985.
It is not known how the relic ended up in Europe.
In recent years, Egypt has been actively seeking the repatriation of antiquities illegally removed from the country at various times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations by "black diggers".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, then only 42 thousand people live in the Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
The only thing that unites them is the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, a bank can review information on corporate devices issued to its employees because they are used to conduct business with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to conduct a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have transitioned to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used for work.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse declined to comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is no longer part of any literary associations, he has abandoned imagism, he is on his own, but he is well-known, in demand, is sometimes strongly criticized by critics, even maliciously, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian Motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Russia Soviet" was published.
And the main success was at the end of June of the 25th year when Gosizdat concluded a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
No one of the contemporary poets honored Sergey Alexandrovich with such a distinction, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the salary was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (for example, the director of the plant received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Money was needed more than ever that year.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy Sofia Tolstoy, it was necessary to set up a family life, to support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
It seems that life has settled down, there is something to be happy about, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark colors, as if the nightmare from the poem “The Black Man ” (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin ’ s death) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Either the wind is whistling
Over the empty and deserted field,
It's like a forest in September,
Alcohol dulls the brain.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin had lost a lot of weight, looked terrible, and was obviously ill.
There are more and more stumbles, nervous breaks.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was ever given to Sergei Alexandrovich, there are no reliable documents left.
Let's say, referring to May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Iseadora Duncan, was recovering his health in a clinic near Paris under the supervision of Professor Peter Gannushkin (Yesenin will come to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But there is plenty of evidence of the poet's drunkenness, scandals on this subject, and references to the police: there are dozens of memoirs on the subject.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the poet's terrifying novel with a green snake has been developing rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Yesenin stayed for a short time with a friend, the icon painter Ivan Startsev.
It is amazing, but Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own home in Moscow or St. Petersburg, he found himself in rented apartments, in hotels or with friends.
Startsev recalls:
"He would only come at night, and in most cases in an inebriated, drunk state.
Once, returning home at four in the morning, Yesenin fell on the landing...
Falling, he scratched his face and whimpered.
When he came to, he started coughing uncontrollably, spitting up blood all over the sheets."
And Yesenin himself, after a voyage through Europe and the United States (in the United States there was a dry law, but Duncan had a decent supply of alcohol with her) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there, just bars and streets...
I stopped remembering people at the end.
Well, and he drank, of course...
And I drank because I was bored."

Now the son is almost 16, and he hasn’t had the urge to smoke for a long time.
All his energy is focused on choosing what he will make a living from.
He is much more responsible than I was in his years or my husband, who had periodic problems with the law even before the wedding.
The father takes care of his young daughter.
And loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love".
Why did the girl cry during the exam, when she hadn’t even failed it yet?
Why he didn't tell his daughter it wasn't a school.
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
It will be relayed.
Millions of students know this.
What are we even talking about?
The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon" against the EU
The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapons"
Deputy Foreign Minister of Poland Pawel Jablonski expressed the opinion that the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as "weapons" against the European Union and intends to return to such "operation" next year.
The deputy foreign minister made the corresponding statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily “stopped Lukashenko”, but he is “actively looking for new ways”.
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will use as a weapon “in many parts of the world”.
As the kp.ru website wrote, the European Union previously introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He implicated 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they announced their readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not by Senka hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man a laughingstock
The 2021 secular events were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion statement was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film ‘It’s not time to die’, he appeared in a velvet maroon jacket and a traditional ‘Bond’ bow tie.
After his example, Prince William followed twice, who first put on the award ceremony of the environmental award The Earthshot Prize an inappropriate royal dress code green velvet jacket, and then chose a more classic option for the event in support of the charity foundation Royal Variety.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messi tried out the trend.
The footballer came to collect the seventh Golden Ball in a Dolce & Gabbana velvet jacket.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress is already seeing a growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to the service's analysts, who spoke to Gazeta.Ru, they started buying them 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a slim silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - suits of velvet they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options include H&M, Mango, next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, suits made of velvet are represented in almost all brands this season – Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is considered to be the Gucci model, in which the brand's ambassador Jared Leto appeared in one of the premiere films "The House of Gucci".
When choosing jackets from expensive brands, you can be sure that the lining is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of weaving threads, a dense fabric is obtained with a woolly outer texture and a smooth inner side.
Cheaper options are made of cotton or polyamide, but also, respectively, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not its model or style, but appropriateness.
"Velvet requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a festive event - explains Vakhoshkin. - It will also work for those occasions when the invitation indicates a dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie."
Another important criterion, compliance with which makes it possible to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced tuxedo with a surplus, - the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Handsome Brammell" believe. - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to special secular events, where there is always a dress code.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same dressy things: classic trousers with stripes, monochrome shirts, silk ties, loafers with bows, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look out of place.
Fashion experts from "Handsome Brammell" are sure that it would be inappropriate for an ordinary employee in a corporation to appear in a velvet jacket, but if we are talking about "a manager who benefits from this event, then yes, he has such a thing in mind".
If the employee is of a lower rank, and the goal is to advance higher in the company's complex hierarchy or to earn financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will certainly appreciate the phrase "not a Senka hat", the editors of the Telegram channel on men's fashion believe.
Very mixed feelings about the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, it's so strained.
And is not at all associated with the smiling face of a young girl.
To be honest, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But I wish you all the best in life!
It's all about money: alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, paid for.
Billion-dollar investments.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy sources are also not in the red: gas, oil, and coal are being bought cheaper than they are being sold now.
There is a wild demand for fuel.
A little bit is dripping.
And who was in the flight?
As usual, an ordinary shopper.
Does the sheriff care about Indian problems?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who "missed" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good tip.
I didn't see a single beautiful person in the photos in the article.
Just average in terms of the average passenger.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it off for the whole carriage, then they probably won't be impressed.
But only because of mental disorder and ignorance of such "beauties", but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is conscious of his slavery and struggles against it, is a revolutionary.
A slave who does not know that he is a slave, and who pines away in a dumb, unconscious, wordless life of servitude, is simply a slave.
A slave who drools when he smugly describes the delights of the slave life and exults in the kindness and goodness of his master is a slave, a churl."
Immunologist said that revaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the Omicron coronavirus strain
A booster shot four to five months later may protect against the new Omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
Such a statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination after six months, taking into account the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period"
"With the old schedules, this period was normal, but now it's best to have the procedure in five months, and for people with chronic diseases, in four," the expert said, calling for revaccination to be done in parallel with the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early vaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person has received two vaccinations and a booster, or if they have fallen ill and been vaccinated, or if they have been vaccinated and fallen ill, then they have received ‘ hybrid immunity’, that is, there are a lot of antibodies and enough neutralizing antibodies”, the expert clarified.
The Big Seven warned Russia of “massive consequences” in case of invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France, and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have huge consequences and will cost Moscow dearly," but no concrete measures are described in the document.
“We, the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia ’ s military buildup and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine, ” the statement said.
The ministers further urge Russia to “de-escalate, use diplomatic channels, and abide by its international obligations regarding transparency of military activities, ” as US President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine, ” the foreign ministers of the Big Seven also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited under international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price to pay in return," they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome Ukraine's restrained position.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response," the statement added.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said that Russia would face “serious consequences” if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed “the unified voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world ’ s GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia. ”
Pfizer vaccine found 32 times less effective against omicron variant
The vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech is 32 times less effective against the omicron variant of the coronavirus compared to other types of the disease.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports the South China Morning Post.
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug for COVID-19.
"We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant," said Professor Malik Peiris.
At the same time, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against a severe course of the disease in case of infection with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic taking into account the influence of the omicron strain on it.
The authors of the study came to the conclusion that the omicron strain can cause a new wave of virus circulation and an increase in mortality if additional measures are not taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel in blocking the acquisition of lethal weapons by Kiev within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed the purchase by Ukraine of anti-sniper systems and rifles to shoot down drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to acquire the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, this concerns the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania, and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz regarding the approval of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andriy Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect weapons deliveries from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons by the risk of a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite "Russia's occupation" of part of Ukrainian territory.
The diplomat is confident that Germany will maintain the same "illogical" position under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
Ukraine expects Germany "to be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense", the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the Green Party of Germany, Robert Habeck, visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
The foreign ministers of the G7 countries warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continued its military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement of the parties.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of the Russian armed forces at the country's borders.
“There should be no doubt in Russia ’ s mind that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs, ” said a statement published on the UK government ’ s website.
The G7 ministers and the EU's High Representative noted that "they are united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine".
The head of the British Foreign Ministry, Elizabeth Truss, at a press conference in Liverpool, warned of "big consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We made it clear that any incursion would have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to abandon its aggression against Ukraine", she said (quote from TASS).
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the foreign ministers of the G7 agreed that in order to resolve the crisis due to the buildup of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
It was about negotiations in the "Norman format".
The North Atlantic Alliance also spoke out in favour of a “Norman format” dialogue on Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "have shown themselves to be incapable of taking responsibility for their own mistakes."

Ways of returning money stolen through online stores are revealed
There are several ways to get back money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
Their secrets were revealed to RBK by information security experts.
For example, to reduce the risk of large losses if the bank card data falls into the hands of attackers, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that is not used for online shopping.
Part of the savings can be deposited in a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend creating a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen during purchases at stores that do not use the 3D Secure protection technology, it is possible to initiate a refund procedure.
"Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, liability for unauthorized transactions conducted without the use of 3D Secure falls on the participant in the chain of payments who does not use this service," the representative of Promsvyazbank clarified.
An expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay, Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer has the right to file an application to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the perpetrator used a card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be disputed and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Safe Internet League Ekaterina Mizulina reported that only in 2021, 11 thousand appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution in the current circumstances could be the creation of a single window for complaints about online scammers.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
The newly-elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz declared his desire to preserve good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unambiguous expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Moravetsky, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has said it will help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
Poland's judiciary, however, remains a source of controversy.
The European Court fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice Party violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay the fine and its highest court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, which was sworn in on Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not take on public commitments to stop the work of "Nord Stream 2" in the event of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany on halting a natural gas pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional aide said on Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz on Wednesday warned of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's borders, a position reiterated by the G7 representatives on Sunday.

On its basis, literary residencies will be created, the Parlamentskaya Gazeta reported in the Ministry of Culture, which will become the founder of the fund.

The draft decree stipulates that the Fund's statute should state that it is "created to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers".
"The creation of conditions for creative activity" implies the creation of literary residencies on the basis of transferred property in different regions of Russia, in which there would be comfortable conditions for creativity, the Ministry of Culture and Information explained to our publication.

According to Tokarev, citizens believe dubious advice on the Internet and start self-medicating.

And during the preliminary examination before the vaccination, the doctors notice bruises.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without determining the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who found $20,000 in a church wall will be paid
Plumbers who found money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas will receive a reward.
This is reported in the press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place in a large evangelical church Lakewood, where Pastor Joel Osteen preaches, promising that pious Christians are waiting for wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cooley was repairing one of the church toilets and found thousands of packages of money and checks under the insulation.
He passed on the find to the church and said he received no thanks from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done," KPRC-TV quoted him as saying.
The find appears to be connected to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
Then about 200 thousand dollars in cash and 400 thousand dollars in the form of checks, which were stored in the church safe, disappeared.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of $25,000 was announced for information about the criminals.
Justin Cooly could not claim this amount, since the statute of limitations for the award had already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time awarded five thousand dollars and later received another 20 thousand dollars as a gift from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber ’ s honesty.
He will receive $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police interrogated Pastor Joel Osteen about the money found in the wall of the Lakewood Church.

The infection was contracted by a 68-year-old resident of the urban district of Huizhou in the southern province of Guangdong, who kept poultry at home.
His condition is assessed by doctors as critical.
The world's first human infection with the H5N6 virus strain was recorded in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
In Brazil, citizens are required to present vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, it was required to demand a covid-passport from those entering the country, a decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Roberto Barros.
CNN Brasil reported this.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a certificate of vaccination.
Persons arriving from countries where the absence of vaccine has been proven are also included in the list of exceptions.
“The situation is even more serious if we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year ’ s, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow, ” said Barroso.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities imposed a five-day quarantine on tourists who were not vaccinated against coronavirus infection.
A scheme for complete protection from COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, Doctor of Medical Sciences, Honored Scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in a conversation with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection from coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injection and nasal vaccination.
Large amounts of immunoglobulin A are produced when the vaccine is administered intranasally. This does not happen when the vaccine is injected.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus cannot enter the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we produce the most immunoglobulin G (antibodies).
And if you give both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no solution for double vaccination yet," the doctor said.
The chief prophylactologist of the UrFo, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help ensure that the body's defences are presumably at their peak.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod Region David Melik-Guseinov said that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is what is observed in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, hmm...
I used to talk to my dog (who died a long time ago) like this: if you're ready to exchange a warm house, food, affection, love, and playing on the lawn, then go ahead.
But the poodle was trained and generally intelligent.
I chose my society and went home.
In the video, a method that works in 90% of cases.
It wasn't taken off the ceiling, believe me.
I stopped many owners from running after the dog, although they thought that 200,000 were running away (barking), I took it by the hand and led it to the other side.
As a result, "200 thousand" chose the owner, and not the dog that ran off somewhere.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe
More than forty thousand demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital of Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictive measures and plans of the authorities to make vaccination against Covid-19 mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spanish, outraged by the authorities' healthcare policy, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held up placards with the inscription "This is a fake pandemic", "I will not be vaccinated".
A large protest against health passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of several regions of the country against the backdrop of an increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement officers.
A group of demonstrators began to throw stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.

WHO has found the "omicron" in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that a new strain of coronavirus, “omicron”, has been detected in 63 countries.
A number of experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO reported on the spread of the strain.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has already been identified in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
This is despite the fact that it began to spread actively only from the end of November.
WHO also expresses concern about the high rate of spread of the new coronavirus variant.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain, according to preliminary data, may surpass the spread of the Delta strain, which is the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is currently leading in all countries without exception.
Before that, the Director-General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the omicron strain is capable of having a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were drawn in the UK.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will displace "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of cases in the UK alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that officially, "omicron" is currently sick in the UK several hundred people, and according to estimates, up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the omicron strain, and at the peak more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
What the British healthcare system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian "Sputnik V" will react to the "omicron" - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has only just begun to test the Russian vaccine against the Omicron strain.

$135 billion went into applications - Hi-Tech
In 2021, user spending on apps globally grew by 25% and the number of downloads by 8%.
The most popular in the world were various video services.
Most users downloaded the video editor CapCut, and spent the most money on YouTube.
Both the number of app downloads and user spending showed significant growth between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. Spending by users in apps increased even more significantly: by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
Such data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the global economy emerged from the lockdown and began post-pandemic recovery.
“Will this ‘return to physical’ growth of the economy of applications slow down? Not at all”, the authors of the report believe.
The leader in the number of app downloads is India: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of gadgets on iOS, as before, spent more than users with Android: on iOS accounted for 65% of all expenses in applications.
Among the applications, the video editor CapCut took first place in the number of downloads for 2021.
It is followed by two Indian apps: video service MX TakaTak and online shopping app Meesho.
Telegram is also included in the top 10 by number of downloads.
In general, judging by the number of downloads, VPN services are popular among users (there are two of them in the top 10 - VPN Master and NightOwl VPN) and services related to the creation and broadcasting of videos (in addition to CapCut and MX TakaTak, there are two more such services in the top 10 - Moj and SnackVideo).
"Most of all, users spent money on applications for live broadcasts and online streaming," the report's authors note.
YouTube is leading here, the top 5 by user spending also includes the video service TikTok, the streaming video services Disney+ and HBO Max, as well as the Japanese manga subscription service Piccoma.

Across the world, people have adapted to the pandemic by moving to a mobile lifestyle, which could be described as one of the main takeaways.
The industries that have seen the most success are those that help people be closer, both virtually and in person," said Lexi Sydow, head of marketing research at App Annie, commenting on the results of the report.
The revenue of the mobile games sector in 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in the number of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, in which there is no or almost no plot, and the video is minimal.
The top three most popular games in the world are Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, the most popular games are DOP 2, Delete One Part, and Going Balls, as well as Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.

Russians have been warned about a new scam
The perpetrators began to look for new maneuvers for fraud in video messages.
Izvestia writes about this with reference to experts.
According to the director of products at Ivideon, Zaur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the spread of video communication tools is deep fakes.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings with the participation of the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalimov added that using deepfake, attackers can call acquaintances of victims on video chat or create a video with the participation of a copy of a person for distribution with the purpose of blackmail.
"Such hoaxes can easily provoke bullying, as a malicious prankster could place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising fake scenarios," the expert said.
Varonis lead systems engineer Alexander Vetkol noted that people are more likely to trust others when they can see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to technologies using video.

Five things to do to avoid diabetes
Problems with blood sugar levels are some of the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, to their detriment.
Diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death over time.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regimen – reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to plain water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet foods increase blood sugar to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
So the first step to a healthier lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them out of the house.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by improper diet, but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of diabetes, it is necessary to move a lot.
Experts recommend following a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but will also protect against sharp fluctuations in sugar levels.
Eating a lot of fiber is necessary to protect against diabetes.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to the feeling of satiety, the secretion of digestive juices and the increase in the absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova spoke about "weekend migraines" in workaholics
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in health over the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of health after working days is often a "weekend migraine", said a well-known endocrinologist, doctor of medicine, senior researcher at the Faculty of Basic Medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the Clinic of Systemic Medicine Zukhra Pavlova in her Telegram channel.
According to her, workaholics in particular often suffer from this, as they experience headaches, fatigue, and weakness on the weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the accumulated over the week fatigue, there are quite a few objective reasons for the negative reaction of the body to a change in conditions.
Our lives change fundamentally over the weekend.
"We sleep long, lie on the couch all day, most likely eat more, and drink less, - the doctor argued. - Because of the lack of coffee, a small hangover begins.
Because of overeating and lack of water - heaviness and brokenness."
The late surge plays a role.
For example, if you get up three hours later than usual, you will experience a reaction called jet lag.
It occurs in travellers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factors play a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most on the weekends.

South African scientists reported low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
South Africa reported low effectiveness of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
Scientists of the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "Omicron") corresponds to (the level of) vaccine effectiveness of 22.5% against infection with symptoms, which... calls into question the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, "the text of the study, published on the portal MedRxiv, says.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron coronavirus strain could cause a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in everyday foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that an unknown word in the product may indicate a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
There may be several dozen names on the label, in fact, referring to sugar.
Some of the most common and frequently encountered names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other broken down sugars such as dextrose (corn sugar), levulose (fruit sugar), melasses (blackstrap), agave syrup, etc.
These are simple carbohydrates, which belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery products, but also in ketchup, in doctor ’ s sausage, bread, etc.
According to Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to eat whole and unprocessed foods, as well as pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter what the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany, as the country continues the transition to the decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years, the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to be committed to the fact that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas and in the future, since at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbock said that the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline was continuing.
According to the minister, within the framework of coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline "does not yet comply with EU regulations".

In a referendum in New Caledonia, the majority voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the two previous ones.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted during the referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third voting was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results released by the local authorities, 3.51 per cent (2,755) of voters were in favour of independence for New Caledonia from France, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) were against.
The turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 residents of New Caledonia taking part in the elections.
As France-Presse comments on these interim results, “the outcome of these elections left no room for doubt”, since the proponents of independence urged voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic on the archipelago hinders the holding of a full and "honest" pre-election campaign.
Thus, this abstention opened the way to a third victory for the supporters of New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 – 53.3%.
According to the separatists, they do not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, in the Elysée Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to speak following the results of this referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has animated the final weeks of France's presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of keeping the territory as part of France, as it is “the last region of the European Union ’ s presence in the Pacific Ocean ”.
"New Caledonia must remain French," Eric Zemmour has repeatedly said.
The same statement was made by the Republican candidate Valerie Pécresse, who published a column in Le Figaro at the end of October, calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take up the position, "because it is not his responsibility."
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia."
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed a "strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France."

Turkey tests world's first drone with laser weapon
The world's first drone with a laser weapon was successfully tested in Turkey.
The Eren UAV was tested at distances of 100 to 500 meters, MIR24 reports.
The device is capable of neutralizing explosive objects at a distance using a laser.
The maximum flight altitude of the new aircraft is 3,000 meters.
After passing the appropriate tests, the UAV should be supplied to the Turkish military, who will use it to destroy explosive devices without involving sappers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ readers criticized the article about relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized the article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author of the material expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinced readers of the danger coming from Moscow and made a number of insulting statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "stand together against Russia".
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There's a lot of false information in this article," one reader commented to RIA Novosti.
“Europe is not ours to ‘lose’, and Ukraine is not our land.
The United States and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine," another said.

A 5.2 magnitude earthquake occurred near the Kuril Islands
The 5.2-magnitude earthquake struck near the Shikotan island in the Kuril Islands.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was located 231.8 km northeast of the city of North Kurilsk.
The epicenter was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Previously, seismologists recorded an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine to start producing new-generation unmanned aerial vehicles
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the ANKA type will begin to be created.
This was reported on December 11 by Alexei Arestovich, a freelance adviser to the head of the Ukrainian presidential office.
That is, they are capable of acting against airborne objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the fuselage and so on," Dialog.ua quotes him as saying.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA devices, Arestovich said that they are jet-powered, not piston-powered UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after the Bayraktar, which surpasses it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was developed by the Turkish Space Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the eve of the Ukrainian General Staff declassified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the military operations of the joint forces in the Donbas.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky said that the construction of a plant for the production of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, the company Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kyiv region, where personnel will be trained, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called this memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport
Lions escaped at Changi Airport in Singapore.
The Straits Times reported this.
Two predators managed to escape from the container with a family of lions that arrived on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore, and where they were headed.
One of the stray lions lay down on the top of the container.
The animals could not get away from him because of the protective fence installed nearby.
The standoff ended after officials from the Mandai Wildlife Group, which runs all of Singapore's zoos, arrived at the airport.
They tranquilized the lions with darts and plan to transport them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and roamed the streets of the city.
On the same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, and no people were harmed.
Experts have warned of the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not experience a lack of folic acid are less likely to get some types of cancer, in particular, colorectal.
However, exceeding the necessary dose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, nutritionist Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer only increases if you significantly deviate from this figure in either direction.
Kitchen recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor ’ s advice, be sure to follow the dosage and avoid cotton with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, nutrition consultant Rachel Fein called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it's found in avocados, among other things, Fine recommends that men over 50 eat this fruit more often.
About 75,000 people may die in the UK by April due to the omicron strain
The forecasts of British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus in the next five months, up to 75 thousand people may die in England if restrictive measures are not tightened in the winter.
The Guardian reported this, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the scientific and advisory group on emergency situations at the British Cabinet Office, by April 2022, at least 25,000 deaths will be recorded in the country due to the omicron strain, and a total of about 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the epidemic, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Major action to tackle the coronavirus may be needed to avoid overwhelming the National Health Service if the omicron variant proves to be more infectious than the delta variant and current vaccines are unable to prevent infection," said LSHTM mathematician Rosanna Barnard.
Earlier, the UK's Health Security Agency informed that if the rate of spread of the omicron strain remains at the current level, then by the end of the year about 1 million cases of infection will be detected in the country.
By mid-December, the Omicron variant could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, 1898 cases of infection with the omicron coronavirus strain have been detected in the UK, of which 633 were identified in the last 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality this figure may already reach 10 thousand cases.
I wanted to write some clever comment, but I only got as far as this:
"Coat, obtained as a result of the incredible suffering of an unfortunate animal and its re-employment."

Demand for superyachts grew in the world by a quarter
Supertanker construction this year and orders for next year are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and the fight against climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of yachts ordered amounted to 1,200 units – a quarter more than last year.
In the era of the fight against the consequences of climate change for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million dollars and above will not decrease, writes the Guardian.
But there are more and more of them.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say it hasn't been this busy in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of infection on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Previously, all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, but now the vast majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are conducted over the phone.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that yards are taking orders for new yachts in 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more so that their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super-rich can afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize the behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of austerity, travel to space, life on yachts or flights on their own planes cause irritation in society, because the elite does not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are calling on governments to act and are proposing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they acknowledge that it will be extremely difficult to do so with such mobile money.
Meanwhile, the number of super-yachts ordered is impressive, as are their specifications.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have masts longer than 100 meters.
The Norwegian billionaire Røkke is building the 183-metre yacht REV Ocean.
When launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool", as well as a submarine designed for exploring the depths of the sea.
On existing superyachts, there are usually helipads, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as the yacht of the wrestler McGregor, there is a platform for martial arts. Professor of economic anthropology at the American University in Indiana Richard Wilk says that compared to the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, the carbon footprint produced by the super-rich is insignificant.
But it is symbolic, given that there are just over 2,000 billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of the overconsumption of a very small group of people.
Scientists have discovered that the emissions footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average citizen of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the biggest polluter of the planet Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that entered the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the carbon footprint came from his 162.5-metre yacht, the Eclipse.
Even if the owner is not on board the yacht, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to send the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not elicit sympathy from others when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Rinehart, who owns mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that there is no space for their giant vessels to dock.
It is also difficult to understand its call to build marinas for vessels up to 50 meters.
Dangerous weekly dose of alcohol linked to bowel cancer
American scientists have determined what volume of alcoholic beverages per week increases the risk of developing cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts came to the conclusion that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
At the same time, the probability of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
What's more, moderate drinkers have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the exact reason for the development of this type of oncology, noting only that certain factors lead to a process that is harmful to the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they don't realize how advanced the four-legged pets really are.
For many years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence develops in animals.
Although a dog ’ s vocabulary is not as extensive as a human ’ s, a new study shows that a dog can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poetry, they don't understand politics, economics or art, but they often manage to fool their owners.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show the best results in understanding the words of the human language, but the statistical data for accurate conclusions are not yet sufficient.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and are not inferior to a two-year-old child in terms of learning ability.

Ukraine gets ready for US-Russia trade talks
The United States and Russia will "negotiate" about Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for the publication Glavred.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States regarding the fact that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to join anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not bargain, but simply send the offeror away.
And in the case of Ukraine, there is going to be a trade", the analyst wrote.
Kochevtkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but is seeking dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparations are conducted secretly, quickly, and immediately move to offensive actions, rather than waiting for the group to be detected and deploying forces to counter it," he noted.
China stimulates development of railway transport industry
Cutting-edge Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province /Central China/.
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotives Co., Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, said Hou Zhaowen, a representative of the company.
The high-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and serviceability of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing the "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-level high-speed electric trains developed in China, designed for export to Europe, rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of a metro train developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began.
The train will move along the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the city's airport.
The metro line will open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
“China ’ s railway equipment industry is one of the sectors with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness, ” said Feng Yaoqiang, head of the trade and investment department of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade.
"This industry constitutes the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-end equipment manufacturing in the global market," said Feng Yaoyang.
After more than 60 years of hard work, through a series of independent research and development, China has created an advanced railway transportation equipment manufacturing system, with a complete set of supporting facilities and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoqian, the country ranks first in the level of electrification of railways and in the operating mileage of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist listed early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semyon Goloseykin listed the early signs of dementia in a conversation with Sputnik radio.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive disorders, such as inability to concentrate, planning, a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
Currently, there is a discussion that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Goloshekin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that to date, doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly exercising cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intense engagement of memory and logic.
"There are recommendations for the use of various BADs, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still being discussed in the scientific community," Goloshekin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking," Goloshekin said.
Earlier, a charity researching dementia in the UK said the disease was increasingly affecting people in their 40s.
Doctors have named the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered the problems with vision, due to which the patient has difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts say, is aphasia, a condition in which a person can't find the right words to say what he or she wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psycho-neurological treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the council of doctors established by the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is the leading factor in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with mobility, coordination, variability of character," the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neuro-rehabilitation and psychoneurotic rehabilitation, the possibility of which we did not find in Georgia, ” said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotage the provision of medical assistance after the penitentiary service subjected him to disciplinary punishment.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to reverse the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Protests against COVID passports took place in Spain
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate took place in the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, Europa Press agency reports.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was approximately 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID-19 passports have become mandatory to enter bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
With slogans on their placards, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city declared a medical dictatorship and called the vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated.
The government submitted bills on a unified QR code system to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering facilities and retail trade with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a transferred disease, or a vaccination card.
The same rules will be established for train and air travel.

A steep rise: how the Chinese are becoming skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country
China hopes that the Olympic Games will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow to collect the 1 trillion yuan designated by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
Ski resort Taifu in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming more and more popular among the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, work is also being done on landscaping: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task in the long term is to ensure a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become residents.
However, there is still a long way to go.
Games organizing adviser Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every winter, more and more Chinese are sent to the slopes.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many years to build a ski culture here, Downs said.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation needs to be created there.
Gao Macong, 70, lives in Chongli, near the site of the Winter Olympics.
He notes that there has been a boom in winter sports tourism in recent years.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway was built from Beijing to Chongli, and now not a single local resident suffers from unemployment.
More and more stores selling clothes and equipment for winter sports are opening in the country.
Restaurants serving national cuisine are opening on the slopes.
Taipei now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders of the largest international competitions, and resorts and equipment should reach the world level.
More than 500 million people worldwide could fall into extreme poverty because of the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed down the progress of humanity in terms of universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank said.
On the occasion of the International Day of Universal Health Coverage, 12 December, WHO and the World Bank published two complementary reports.
In them, they stated that the pandemic led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, caused excessive stress in the healthcare systems.
As a result, immunization coverage has fallen for the first time in 10 years, and deaths from tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
The WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic has caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment."
This situation pushes more than 500 million people into "extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their pocket."
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that the coronavirus pandemic had pushed more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people have little or no social support.

Reuters: the Taiwanese minister was cut off from the "Summit for Democracy" broadcast at the request of the White House
The speech of Taiwan's Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tang at the panel discussion during the US-organized "Summit for Democracy" was translated into the off-video mode, according to the recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, claims that the picture was turned off at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map in which Taiwan was highlighted in a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map that Ms. Tan showed was produced by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries around the world according to their level of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as “open”, while China, North Korea, Laos, and Vietnam were highlighted in red as “closed”.
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot with the note that the opinions of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily express the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map that the Taiwanese minister showed could be at odds with Washington’s “one China” policy.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map demonstration, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Summit for Democracy, organized by Washington, was held from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Yury Averyanov, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov assessed the prospects for relations between Moscow and Washington in an interview with Izvestia.
He noted that the long path of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries began not yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, it is completely unpredictable.
It's a sad conclusion after the long road we've been down with this administration and with Trump and with Obama.
The problems didn't start yesterday," the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's desire to impose its approaches on Russia on a number of issues.
The deputy head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs added that he would not risk giving optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, with the exception of such areas as strategic stability and cyber security, there is no progress.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of reason.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of danger of nasal spray vaccine against COVID outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may experience an allergic reaction and need medical assistance, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported to TASS by virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of biotechnology, microbiology and virology at the Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
It would be easier to set up vaccination points for the nasal vaccine at airports and shopping malls, but I would only do this in the early stages at medical facilities.
The fact is that the probability of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine exists, it is small, but it is desirable for a person to sit next to the doctor's office after that.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work literally within a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," Netsov said.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccinating in shopping centers when the experience of using the drug has been accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person being vaccinated sneezes after the injection while their nose is blocked.

1,239 cases of the omicron variant of the coronavirus were recorded in the UK in 24 hours - RT in Russian
Over the past 24 hours, 1,239 cases of infection with the new omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the UK.
Sky News reports this.
In particular, 1196 new cases of the "omicron" strain were recorded in England, 38 people fell ill with a new variant of the infection in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of cases of COVID-19 from the new strain in the UK has reached 3137 people.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in a pessimistic forecast calculated that in England by April, due to the outbreak of coronavirus caused by the Omicron strain, 75 thousand people could die.
Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
The press secretary for the Russian president, Dmitry Peskov, commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of continued “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including because of the alleged “invasion” of the country’s territory.
"It's impossible to impose some restrictions on Russia and not suffer yourself," the Kremlin spokesman said on the Rossiya 1 television channel.
Peskov claims that "everyone in the world understands this".
Earlier it was reported that the United States is considering the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as a last resort.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
However, Sberbank CEO Herman Gref is confident that this is impossible.

Residents of New Caledonia rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of participants refused to leave France.
The French television channel BFM.TV reported this on December 12.
96.5% of those who voted were against independence.
3.51% of the residents of the archipelago in the South Pacific supported independence from France.
The results of 2.99% of the ballots were annulled.
The voter turnout on this day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago's residents came to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by calls from separatists to abandon participation in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, residents of New Caledonia voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was already held in the region.
Most residents supported the archipelago remaining part of France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270,000 people live on the archipelago, which has a special administrative and territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and New Caledonia's administration allows the region to hold a vote on independence every two years.

WHO preliminary considers "omicron" less dangerous than "delta"
The World Health Organization (WHO) preliminary considers that the "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
However, there is evidence that vaccines are less effective against the new variant of COVID-19.
According to information on December 9, "omicron" has been registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the Omicron strain's protein suggest a reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it (the severity of the disease - ed.) may be less severe than in the "delta" case, the WHO technical bulletin states.
The organization notes that all registered cases of infection with "omicron" in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, is spreading faster than the "delta".
Two cases of infection with the omicron strain have been registered in Russia.
They were "previously immunized," the Gamaleya Center said.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova said that there is no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
The ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadym Denisenko listed four scenarios for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state can remain without the support of the West, and also, possibly, will compromise on Donbass.
Denisenko spoke about this on Sunday, 12 December, in a publication on the portal Glavred.
The first option, which Denisenko called an “ideal storm ”, assumes that Ukraine will no longer be supported by key Western countries, having reached an agreement on the country ’ s future without its participation.
Such a development of events will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"In parallel, there is a decrease in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> internal protests and opposition to the authorities with key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.)," the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will fail if there is high turbulence in world politics, in which case the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this situation, the leadership of Ukraine may compromise on Donbass, as a result of which there may be confrontation within the country.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, and the probability of such a situation, according to the former Narddepa, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is a confrontation between groups of people who disagree with Zelensky and the president, because of which it is likely that control over the power block will be seized and "populist initiatives" will be implemented.
In this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting power", Denisenko added.
Another scenario is the transformation of Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
This can be caused by some event that will be a great shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to cause a reaction from external partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a man-made catastrophe, or aggressive actions by Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has already rejected any "attack" on Ukraine more than once.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO, and the United States that are increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the results of a survey by the sociological group Rating showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest rating since he was elected head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the case of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the country's former president, Petro Poroshenko.
At the same time, only 19.3% of those surveyed expressed support for the president.

Thank you for the story about the great athlete, I didn't know that Elena Shushunova had died, it's very sad to find out.
I remember how I was rooting for her at the Olympics in Seoul; for us, residents of the Primorsky Territory, it was a live broadcast, real time.
Such an outpouring of emotions, the emotions were running high, I remember the joy when Elena won.
The rest of the victories also made them happy, as they cheered for Salnikov, the football players, and all of the Soviet athletes at the time.
On TV, I once saw a documentary about one of the Central American countries, and there, watermelons rolled down the gangplank onto the ship like barrels.
The watermelons were huge.
I myself have worked many times in my youth on the harvesting and loading of watermelons in the Astrakhan region, and I have never encountered a watermelon weighing more than a poodle.
I buy watermelons weighing 4-5 kg straight from the vine and not earlier than the beginning of August.

Busthalter balcony with soft lace cups, on the racks.
The lower detail of the cup is reinforced with non-elastic transparent fabric.
The side inner part of the cup, in the area of ​ ​ the attachment of the bra strap, is reinforced with inelastic fabric in a fold, without additional seams for comfort.
It is this element that prevents the lace from stretching.
The wealth of lace can be appreciated thanks to the festoon along the décolletage and under the bust.
The vertical ribs on the side panels of the single-layer microfiber do not allow the fabric to crumple at large sizes.

Arrested for an action on Red Square, the poet: "For a quote from Yevtushenko, they give 10 days, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
An HSE student was detained in Red Square with a placard on which the hashtag #poetofRussiaismorepoet was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was issued a protocol under the administrative article on repeated violation of the procedure for holding a public event.
He was detained for the first time on January 23 at Pushkinskaya Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of the culture of the common in Russia and also little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag", - explains Alexander.
We reached out to the young poet to find out the circumstances of his detention and get a more detailed message of his message.
How were you treated by the police when you were detained?
What was asked in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the officers were more courteous, keeping the detention to a minimum, polite, as ridiculous as that sounds in some contexts.
At Pushkinskaya, OMON officers grabbed and grabbed hard.
They asked the standard questions about motives.
When they heard, in principle, watched if not approving, then understanding.

Researchers talk about how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals that contribute to improving blood circulation and lowering cholesterol levels.
The root vegetable contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic acid and pantothenic acid.
All of these elements help the body's systems function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to the high content of pectin, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for maximum benefit, root vegetables are better steamed or boiled, rather than fried in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate-containing foods that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar, soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Kommersant newspaper warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a decrease in its production in private subsidiary farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex search
Candidates for elimination
In 2015, copyright holders from the RAEC / Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest runet pirate sites, and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, general director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some, such as Kinogo, Lostfilm, and Filmix, have managed to survive, thanks in part to regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search results of both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series Game of Calmara and Tenderness by director Anna Melikyan, the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (included in AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available as a search engine, you can watch the animated newcomer Enkanto, but judging by the quality of the video, this is a so-called bootleg (shot in a movie theater pirated copy of the film).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the series "Univers. 10 years later" from the TNT channel (part of Gazprom-Media) is available.

Matras Dimax Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
Micro Ultimate orthopedic spring mattress.
The model is convenient because it has two different surface softness - high rigidity and slightly more medium.
The composition of the product includes only high-quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively from the best side.
Springs: in the center of the model there is a block of independent springs "micropacket".
This means that there are 2,000 springs in the bed, which work completely autonomously.
It is their functioning that provides a unique point-by-point adjustment.
The "Micro Pack" is the highest frequency of all the many varieties of Dimac's spring blocks, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillers: from the top and bottom of the springs are installed a combination of layers of coir and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the tiles.
If one surface is covered in latex, the other is covered in coconut coir.
Such a tandem of fillers has not carried the status of classical for a long time, since it transmits not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties to the mattress.
If the couch provides proper support for the back, the latex provides an adaptation of the surface to the human body.
Collar: the model is supplied in the stretched knitted collar Aloe Vera.
At the customer's request, it can be made both detachable and stationary.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load on the sleeping place is 170 kg.
Guarantee and safety: the guarantee period is 3 years.
Matras received all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic foam used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certification.
Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, Actual Camera reported on Sunday.
The goal of the missions starting in five years is to assess the habitability of the clouds of Venus, and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools for measuring acidity and oxygen content in the clouds of Venus.
Until now, it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, the planet closest to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally a terrestrial planet.
A sample from Venus should arrive during the third mission.
If we find life there, the big question will be whether it's similar to life on Earth or different.
If it's very similar, then it's obvious that life didn't start on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life originated on Earth," said Mikkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project.

Metaverses will change Russian business
The theme of the metaverse became popular this fall, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event became an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaviruses should be considered as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, there is a trend towards creating remote interactions during the pandemic, because people are tired of isolation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of businesses' desire to develop ecosystems and adapt their operational models to them.
With the third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to a digital format.
Anya, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want something too fatty and unhealthy anymore.
Of course, we'll have the traditional olive and herring under a blanket, but no one is forcing me to eat it all at once.
You can eat it with a spoon, try it - and it's enough.
After all, there are indeed ten weekends ahead, and you can prepare any tasty and healthy dishes.

The British economist was unable to give a forecast for 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not give a forecast for 2022, since, in his opinion, such attempts will end in failure.
He wrote about this in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, with inflation in second place, he believes.
Mr O'Neill also admitted he did not know whether the rise in prices was temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of central banks' infinite generosity has already outlived itself" and it was time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking inflation into account, would correlate with the expected growth rate of GDP.
O'Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-easy economic policies could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and climate change, O'Neill summarized.
Earlier, the head of the global research department at Otkritie Investment, Mikhail Shulgin, said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate in 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar's exchange rate, Shulgin named the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices, and fears amid the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But there is one thing that makes me happy: if you compare yourself with yourself, then five years ago there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
Progress is there, only slow.
There is another problem: there are many environmental initiatives in the cities, but people don’t know about them.

Russians gave car dealers about 4.5% of the country's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to the statistical data of the agency Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale, roughly the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia leads the market in Russia in terms of revenue.
In the first 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
Kia's sister brand Hyundai saw an even more significant increase of more than 35%, with revenue from car sales estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In the leading positions, this brand and in terms of increasing the average price of the car - for a year at Hyundai it grew by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - the dynamics of the price increase was stronger only at Changan, Chery and Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, the sales volumes of Korean brands grew not so significantly: according to the statistics of the Automobile Manufacturers Committee of the Association of European Businesses in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai - almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
Following the Japanese is Mercedes-Benz with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) – the German premium brand increased both the volume of sales (by 37%) and the average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz is simultaneously experiencing good sales growth and a weighted average price - more, for example, than BMW - hence greater growth in financial capacity," explained NAPI CEO Tatiana Arabadj. -
Chinese brands are showing fantastic sales growth rates and have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year."
In terms of income growth, the Russian Lada demonstrates average market indicators (plus 28%), Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
At last year's level of financial capacity are companies whose sales of vehicles in units in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubish and Nissan.
Overall, UAZ is in the red: in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickup trucks of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of automotive components and disruptions in production affecting the entire global automotive industry, car companies continue to adjust prices on an ongoing basis: the same AvtoVAZ increased the cost of Lada models seven times in a year, the latest price hike (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Prices are regularly revised for their products and other automakers.
The volume of the automobile market in Russia will continue to grow in monetary terms - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation also contributes to this, as well as the desire of car manufacturers to recoup past losses, experts believe.
In the context of a shortage of cars, I think that many car companies were even able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of previous periods, which they could not lay in the price of cars earlier.
Vladimir Bespalov, an auto industry analyst at VTB Capital, says:
I think carmakers are feeling pretty good financially at the moment with high margins."
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As supply increases, the opportunity to raise prices will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, car manufacturers will be able to get their income from the volume, says Sergey Burgazliev, an independent automotive consultant.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, car manufacturers are now striving to make the most profit from each car sold, notes Burgazliev.
Increases in the volume of machine production are not expected for at least the next six months, while in Russia the frenzy is fueled by citizens' uncertainty about the future.
Against the backdrop of the market situation, cars turned out to be a good investment object – a car bought a year ago, even with a mileage, can now be sold for more than its original cost, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about the deployment of US troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The US leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a “Russian invasion”.
This statement was made by US President Joe Biden.
“There has never been such a plan”, the head of the White House said in response to a journalist’s question about whether the US had abandoned this idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the US and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades the territory of Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to the Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
“We will have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 – all those NATO countries for which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack by Russia, ” Biden said.
Earlier, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use by Kiev of drones supplied by Turkey, as well as in the fact that “American weapons are approaching our territory”.
I am immediately leaving such interviews.
If they already want to make me listen to screams, wait for hours, drink incomprehensible broth and wash another cup at the interview, it's scary to imagine what it will be like at work.

If a fraudster calls from such a number, like “an employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs” or another law enforcement agency, it is ineffective to immediately hang up, and it is unlikely that you will have time to add them to your blacklist.
Because in order to confirm his lie about involvement with the security services, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and cajole.
More useful recommendations are needed for the people.
