At Zhejiang University’s Annual Academic Conference, Students Take the Lead, and Their Research Findings Open Up New Horizons - Xinhua Net
Washing hands with air, judging diseases by breathing, and accurately searching for the source of haze. Last night, at the opening ceremony of Zhejiang University’s 2016 Academic Conference, a series of groundbreaking academic achievements were recognized.
The main researchers of these achievements are students. The research covers various fields such as environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science and humanities education. From a curious idea, the students have created many high-end inventions with application value. Some of these projects have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensors: Your Home Diagnostic Doctor
The team of Zhang Di-ming, a doctoral student at the School of Biomedical Engineering and Technology, demonstrated a biosensor for smartphones, which is only half the size of a smartphone.
"You just need to exhale gently, and the instrument can preliminarily detect your health condition from the composition of the gas you exhale. "
Zhang Diming said that the sensor is connected to a smartphone, and the health report will be displayed on the phone after exhaling gas.
Smart wristbands that can detect health conditions on the market generally detect physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biosensors uses graphene, a new material. Its target is chemical elements, and its keen “sense of smell” allows it to more deeply and accurately reflect the state of health.
Smart surgical lights: doctors' high-powered eyes
In addition to smartphones, smart operating lights are also used in operating rooms.
This invention won the silver medal at the 44th Geneva International Invention Exhibition in Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, graduate students of the School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, opened up a new idea in the defects of traditional operating lamps and invented the intelligent LED operating lamp.
"The early detection and excision of many diseases are not in place, which is related to the lamps used by doctors in the operating room. "
Shen Junfei said that, for example, in the early detection of cancer, if doctors cannot see all the tumor tissue in time, the cancer cells will spread later.
The smart surgical lamp has four light disks that can be adjusted to enhance the contrast of different tissues under the light.
During the operation, the doctor can adjust the size, brightness, spectrum, color uniformity and shadowless rate of the light spot at any time according to the needs of the operation and personal habits.
This intelligent operating lamp has been tested in hospitals such as Shaw Shaw Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Children’s Hospital Affiliated to the School of Medicine of Zhejiang University, and has received good feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup.
Washing hands with air: Cool and water-saving
Ordinary people wash their hands with water, at most rub some soap, squeeze some hand sanitizer, while Li Qizhang and other students invented a set of "air hand washing device".
By standing on the sink, our weight compresses the air.
"It's like a bicycle pump.
The compressed air forms a fluid at the faucet and mixes with the water.
So we can wash our hands! "
Colour reaction and bacteria residue tests proved that the effect of washing hands by this method is the same as that of ordinary washing methods.
This device only needs to rely on our own gravity as the driving force. It can ensure the degree of cleaning and save 90% of the water. The whole process is completely energy-saving and environmental protection.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Major Challenges Summit, this invention stood out among the world’s top universities and won the only gold medal.

A meaningful certificate - first aid certificate
This is one of the most important skill certificates I have other than my driving license!
Popularize: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue when the emergency happens, that is, the rescue before the ambulance comes.
As we all know, there is actually a period of time between the accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is when first aid comes in.
If I really have a heart attack, a stroke, respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
So how important it is to have people around you who know first aid!
When someone falls down around us, we can rescue him through professional knowledge, rather than standing there stupidly and doing nothing. This helpless feeling is too terrible.
"In China, we have 3 million people dying unexpectedly every year, and the most dangerous one is cardiac arrest.
Nationwide, the average is 15%.
In casino hotels in Las Vegas, 70% to 80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, the rate is less than 1%. "
This is what the founder of First Response, Lu Le, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest, there is no breathing and no heartbeat, pinching the bridge of the nose is of no use.
Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed in order to save the person.
I found that few people have the awareness to learn first aid now, but it’s too late when things happen, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react in time when facing emergencies.
Maybe even save a life!
You can sign up at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Zhuhai Red Cross training center, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is to record the goals to be completed before the age of 25. It is also a few months ago to add the first aid certificate to the list of goals, but it is really completed!
Then I will go to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a diving certificate. I saw a diving emergency certificate on Xiaohongshu before. It seems that I have to have an emergency certificate to take this certificate. So the emergency certificate is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER#

Because I clearly saw that it was valid when I entered the code earlier.
First of all, I personally believe that “Sleepless in Beijing” is a comprehensive bad film, in every sense of the word.
But it's not like there's nothing to like about the movie, at least the soundtrack is good.
There are many kinds of bad movies, some of which can make you fall asleep in the cinema, and some of which can make you indignant after watching them. “Skyfire” is like a monkey on Mount Emei. It can ignite your anger in countless ways.
In terms of insulting the audience, Han Han is really gifted.
The most painful thing about the film is that it feels like a creature from a Kafka novel, indescribable and riddled with holes like the trenchcoat worn by Travis Bickle.
Even after you've seen it, you wonder if there's some directorial subtext, but when you think about it, it's just a pile of shit.
First of all, I'm going to talk about some of the plot points that I found difficult to understand.
The protagonist lives on a small island in the southern part of the country and lives with his grandmother.
Her grandmother had a wish to see snow, and then the plot arranged for an elderly man in the neighborhood to drive her to Northeast China to see the snow in a minivan.
Elderly man sits in van from south to northeast to see snow?
He and his dad are very comfortable with that.
And that was the end of the old man.
How did the woman’s brother get a business license to open a hotel on a derelict ship?
How can a bunch of bikers on an island close a mountain road so easily?
Then the truck carrying the rebar in the middle of the road stopped on the side of the road, with no truck driver in sight.
It's so obvious.
How did a petty thug with a bad credit record and a criminal record become an auxiliary police officer?
Why didn’t you call the police when you were faced with usury? In the movie, the police specifically asked if you had any difficulties?
An adult knows how to use a smartphone, but doesn’t know how to use a hotel card to open the door, and then forcefully arrange to find the hotel owner and sleep outside the door of the room for a night?
This nonsensical plotting permeates the entire film, and it's so ridiculous that I find it painful to even think about it.
Apart from the plot, what's worse is the film's message, or lack thereof, which is a grotesque Frankenstein's monster.
At the beginning of the film, you would think that he wanted to make a comedy. After more than 20 minutes, you would guess that it might be an inspirational film. Halfway through, you would think that it might be a drama film to show how difficult it is for young people in small towns to survive. After watching it, you don’t even know what you have seen, and you are deeply suspicious of yourself. Why did you go to the cinema to enjoy shit on New Year’s Day?
For most people, they are actually very familiar with the tricks of all kinds of movies. For example, if you want to shoot a motorcyclist, it is inspirational + comedy, and then tell the audience how a talented rookie becomes successful step by step.
If you want to make a romantic comedy, you tell the story of a small-town boy who loves motorcycles and a waitress who loves him.
If you want to reflect reality, then at the very least your plot should not contradict the normal world.
(For example, Yin Zheng’s new motorcycle was just burned, and then he can sing the role), you can’t open some brain holes even Kennedy can’t stand.
As for the heroine, she is not mentally retarded, but she behaves like a 5-year-old in some respects. I don’t know whether this is due to her acting skills or the director’s requirements.
I also don’t understand why Han Han, as a race car driver, is so keen on adding car crash scenes in his own movies.
Why would such a film be released during the Spring Festival holiday?

Yixin inspection well brick machine equipment is widely used in coal, heat, water, electricity, gas and other municipal underground structures of new building materials.
For example, all kinds of inspection wells, rainwater outlets, square ditches, septic tanks and small structures, bridge wing walls, etc.
The advantage of using concrete modules to build inspection wells is that the modules are surrounded by concave and convex grooves on the top, bottom, left and right, which form a chain link when combined.
The shear resistance of the wall of the shaft is much better than that of the horizontal friction masonry.
The module is a hollow structure, and the longitudinal holes are interconnected and the transverse holes are interpenetrated after combined masonry. After pouring the core, a cast-in-place concrete mesh structure is formed, which plays a role in secondary reinforcement and waterproofing.
The module is equipped with slots for transverse and longitudinal reinforcing bars, which can improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, the inspection wells and drainage wells built with concrete inspection well modules are not prone to collapse, subsidence, leakage and other phenomena. The wall module of the well has stable mechanical properties, simple operation and standard shaping size.

Chongqing Vocational Schools Pilot Modern Apprenticeship System - Xinhua Net
Yesterday, the reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprentice system" talent training model in 60 secondary vocational schools. The students who accept the pilot training will have the status of apprentice. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires that the enrollment and admission procedures of vocational secondary schools and enterprise employment be standardized, and that the dual identities of apprentice vocational secondary school students and enterprise probationary employees be clarified. According to the principle of two-way choice, apprentices, schools and enterprises shall sign a tripartite agreement. For apprentices who have reached the age of 16 but have not reached the age of 18, the apprentices, guardians and schools and enterprises shall sign an agreement to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific positions, teaching contents and rights and interests protection of the apprentices on the job.
Pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the form of modern apprenticeship to jointly carry out pre-employment training and transfer training for enterprise employees with cooperative enterprises.
The pilot schools should reform the talent training model.
Universities and enterprises jointly design talent training programs, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards and corresponding implementation plans.
The pilot is conducted in one pilot cycle, and the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training program. The internship is generally 6 months.
In enterprise practice, enterprise team management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different majors, one master can take 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group to ensure that students can master the skills required for each training position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city will determine 60 municipal vocational modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches. Each pilot project will have about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
In accordance with the principle of pilot first and then implementation, and gradually promote from the point to the surface, we will explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint recruitment, joint cultivation and integrated education between schools and enterprises, so as to effectively enhance the job skills of students and improve the employment rate and quality of students.

South African doctor: Omicron is highly contagious but mostly mild
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of COVID-19 are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
As the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa’s Gauteng province reported that the symptoms of COVID-19 patients they were treating were mild, such as body aches and coughs similar to the flu, according to the Associated Press.
The group's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, says he sees dozens of patients a day, but none have needed to be hospitalized.
"They are able to control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation," Piller said.
He said this includes elderly patients and those with pre-existing health conditions, who are more likely to develop severe illness from a coronavirus infection.
In comparison, he said, in the previous wave of the Delta variant, the COVID-19 patients he treated "were short of breath and had low oxygen levels.
A lot of people are going to be hospitalized in the next few days."
Within two weeks of the first reported case of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors shared similar experiences.
While it will take several more weeks to gather enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, only 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in recent weeks have been severely ill, half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; and only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, compared to 20% of earlier cases in South Africa.
Willem Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, saying, "At present, almost all signs indicate that this is a relatively mild disease."
He also said, "It's still early, we need to get the later data.
Normally, hospitalizations and deaths come later, and we're only two weeks into this wave."
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are watching case numbers and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
While Delta remains the dominant strain worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, new cases in Gauteng increased by 400% in the first week of December, with testing showing that the Omicron variant accounts for more than 90% of cases.
Thanks to today’s supporters, all 80 boxes are gone!

Educational Commentary: What to Save Kidnapped Children?
If the analogy of the famous public welfare advertising slogan "no killing without buying and selling", then, in the absence of the "buying and selling" demand of a good environment, group prevention and control, the whole people against trafficking, so that trafficking behavior is unprofitable, high risk, high cost, such crimes will not occur again and again.
Recently, the Child Abduction Information Emergency Release Platform developed by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an Internet information platform created to establish an authoritative channel for the release of information on missing children and to promptly retrieve abducted children.
When I heard that the app was called “Tuan Yuan”, I felt warm.
The new technological means are not only named "literature and art" and full of feelings, but also appropriately applied information, practical and effective.
The primary goal of anti-trafficking law enforcement is to recover abducted children and protect their personal safety and freedom.
Then comes the trial and punishment of suspects.
The meaning of criminal punishment, from individual punishment, social prevention to legal education, many "big words" can be listed.
However, before the abduction case is solved, the personal safety of the victims should be given priority.
There are priorities, and under the urgent goal of “rescue”, controversial topics such as “whether child abduction should be punishable by death in all cases” can be put aside for prudent discussion; however, the rescue of abducted children cannot wait.
Traffickers are known to flee the scene of the crime as soon as they can, according to investigations into such cases.
Every minute of delay in the search and rescue operation means that the child may be farther away from their parents, and the difficulty of the case will increase.
Under such circumstances, it is indeed a pragmatic move to come up with effective measures such as the “Family Reunification” platform, which can directly help solve cases and retrieve children.
After all, "fighting human trafficking" is a big task that requires the whole legal system to do well.
Cracking down on crimes, protecting the rights and interests of children and parents, from the improvement of legislation, to the protection of justice, as well as the meticulousness of law enforcement, all need to implement the care of "protecting the young and helping the weak".
In addition, the prevention of child abduction can be done better from the family to the society.
For example, a common case is that a family of three rests at the railway station. The parents fall asleep, and when they wake up, they find that their child is missing.
A two-year-old cannot be expected to have sufficient self-protection skills, but as a parent of a young child, you should at least be aware of the need for protection.
Taking turns to rest, or putting the child in safe guardianship, are the minimum means to prevent children from being abducted.
From the other side of the police crackdown on kidnapping crimes, the buyers of abducted children should also be paid attention to and punished.
A single wrongdoing is often just one link in a long chain.
According to the provisions of the Criminal Law of our country, the statutory penalty for the crime of abducting and trafficking in children is 5 years; in case of particularly serious circumstances, the death penalty may be imposed, and property may be confiscated.
The starting point of the penalty is high and the maximum penalty is heavy. Under the general trend of “lightening the penalty”, the crime of abducting and trafficking children obviously belongs to the crime with heavier punishment.
However, there are still many kidnapping cases every year.
It can be seen that some people are backward in terms of raising children and have a weak sense of law.
Legal education for these people should be carried out simultaneously.
Effective control of abduction and trafficking crimes cannot be achieved solely through strict law enforcement by the authorities.
If the “market” for kidnapping is widespread, and kidnappers are driven by greed and constantly innovate their means of kidnapping, the anti-kidnapping campaign will inevitably fall into the quagmire of inefficiency.
Therefore, eliminating backward ideas and popularizing legal knowledge will also help eradicate the crimes of kidnapping and buying children.
Yang Haodong Propagandizes the Spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee and the Provincial Party Congress at Malanshan
Drawing Strength from the Party’s 100-Year History of Struggle
Hunan Daily, December 10 (Reporter Gong Bowei) According to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Haodong, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Publicity Department of the Provincial Party Committee, gave an interactive lecture at the Malanshan Video Cultural and Creative Park to thoroughly study and implement the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, study and implement the important instructions and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech on Hunan, and study and implement the spirit of the 12th Party Congress of Hunan Province.
Yang Haodong expounded on the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress from three perspectives, namely, ideals and beliefs and original aspirations, self-revolution and youthfulness of the Party, and Party leaders and Party theory, with his own insights and personal experiences, and explained them in a comprehensive and systematic manner.
He pointed out that it is necessary to combine the spirit of the plenary session with the important instructions and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech in Hunan, the spirit of the provincial party congress, and study them thoroughly, so as to enhance the ideological awareness, political awareness and action awareness of defending the "Two Establishments" and achieving the "Two Maintenances", and unswervingly move forward along the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
In the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprise representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishments", how cultural enterprises should grasp the orientation, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the history of the Party in the past 100 years. Yang Haodong answered these questions with simple language and vivid examples. He sincerely advised young Party members to draw strength from the Party’s 100-year struggle history, closely unite around the CPC Central Committee, unswervingly follow the Party, and dedicate their youth to their responsibilities and duties.

Actually, I don’t know if it’s the shop’s mistake or the rider’s mistake
There was no paperwork on the bag
Can't trace it
I want you to understand
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than it showed
No, thank you.
Yes, a new jockey has been brought in
He's been waiting a long time
The restaurant has been saying it's in the works
Waited for hours
The International Olive Oil Council divides olive oil into two categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, and five grades.
Extra virgin olive oil, also known as virgin olive oil, is the oil obtained from the direct mechanical cold pressing of fresh olive fruit, after filtration and other treatments to remove impurities.
There are three levels depending on the acidity:
Extra Virgin Olive Oil: The highest grade and highest quality olive oil, it is a pure natural product.
It has a delicate floral aroma and an acidity of less than 1%.
Fine Virgin: Higher acidity, but not more than 2%, pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin Olive Oil: Acceptable taste and flavor, acidity not exceeding 3.3%.
Refined olive oil is olive oil obtained by refining virgin olive oil with an acidity higher than 3.3%, or "secondary oil".
There are two grades of refined olive oil:
Ordinary olive oil (Olive Oil): Refined olive oil mixed with a certain proportion of extra virgin olive oil to blend flavor and color, its acidity is less than 1.5%, transparent light golden yellow.
Refined olive-pomace oil: Olive oil obtained by solvent extraction from pomace and refined.
If you've read the classification, you'll know that acidity is a very important factor in olive oil.
Just as grapes used to make wine come from different regions and varieties, olives used to make olive oil also come from different regions and varieties.
The best place for olive trees to grow:
The Mediterranean coast has the most suitable soil and climate conditions such as temperature, sunshine, air humidity and rainfall for the growth of olive trees.
Except on the Mediterranean coast, it can only be grown sporadically in suitable areas.
Main production areas (Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon and so on, and its climate is similar to Argentina, Peru, South Africa and so on in the southern hemisphere.
Month of olive harvest:
From March to June, the olive tree flowers and bears fruit. From July to October, the fruit develops and ripens, changing from green to red, purple and finally black.
The harvest season is from November to February (the freshness of the olive oil is very important).
Nutritional composition of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid and linoleic acid, linolenic acid, as well as vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is considered to be the most nutritious oil found to date.
Democracy Summit Ends, Biden Says Flame of Freedom Cannot Be Extinguished
The online Summit for Democracy, convened by US President Joe Biden and attended by leaders from 110 countries, civil society and the private sector, concluded on Friday (December 10).
In his closing remarks, Biden said that the flame of freedom burns in the hearts of every person in the world and that it can never be extinguished by authoritarian regimes.
He also said that he plans to hold the second Global "Democracy Summit" next year.
Taiwanese government representative and Councillor of the Executive Yuan, Kolas Yotaka, and Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law, who is currently in exile in the UK, also spoke at the summit the following day.
Biden said, "We know how difficult the task ahead of us is.
But we also know that we can rise to the challenge, because, as I have said before, as this summit has shown, democracy is everywhere.
Despotism can never extinguish the spark of freedom which burns in the hearts of men throughout the world. "
Biden also said that defending democracy requires a concerted effort by society as a whole.
"As leaders of government, we have a responsibility to listen to our citizens, to fortify the guardrails of democracy, to promote reform, to achieve accountable governance with transparency, and to be more resilient to the forces of authoritarianism and the naked pursuit of power at the expense of the public good," he said.
The themes of the second day of the "Democracy Summit" were defending human rights, consolidating democracy and confronting authoritarianism, and countering digital authoritarianism and affirming democratic values.
This day coincides with "International Human Rights Day".
In his opening speech on the same day, UN Secretary-General Guterres also said that the cause of democracy is facing challenges globally, especially the challenges brought about by emerging digital technologies.
"Now is the time to reaffirm common values and positions and the resilience of democracy," he said.
This requires deepening social dialogue, addressing inequality, combating corruption, renewing the social contract, investing in quality education and expanding opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires a firm condemnation of all forms of populism, nativism and extremism, including the use of all the tools provided by the technological revolution. "
Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist Nathan Law, who addressed the summit via a pre-recorded video, reminded participants to continue to pay attention to the human rights situation in Hong Kong and in China's ethnic minorities, such as the Uighurs and Tibetans.
He said: "For a long time, the world has accepted China's rise without establishing a mechanism to hold it accountable.
That is why politicians and civil society leaders must work together.
We must use everything we have (resources) to ensure that the revival of democracy is our top priority. "
Nathan Law also called on the free world to unite against the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "Maybe some of you are afraid of upsetting General Secretary Xi Jinping, maybe some of you don’t want to lose the Chinese market, maybe some of you haven’t realized the threat (the CCP) poses to our democratic values.
And that's why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must change. "
Taiwan Executive Yuan Councilor Tang Feng released the "National Statement" through a video during the round table discussion on "Combating Digital Dictatorship and Affirming Democratic Values", emphasizing that Taiwan stands at the forefront of fighting against autocracy and tyranny.
He also shared his experience in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic through information transparency and building mutual trust.
He said, "At a time when Taiwan's democracy is in its infancy, we have always stood firmly at the forefront of the global fight against authoritarianism, and we have played a leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the pandemic, authoritarian governments around the world have used the pretext of public health and the collective good to justify human rights abuses, and there are signs of a global democratic recession.
However, in Taiwan, we don’t have to lock down the city to control the epidemic, and we don’t have to take down false information to defeat it. "
On the second day of the “Democracy Summit”, the US Department of the Treasury announced that it had imposed sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries, including China and North Korea, which were found to have seriously violated human rights, and imposed investment restrictions on a Chinese company that was found to have used surveillance technology to assist in the violation of human rights.

But the restaurant, for some reason, kept pushing back the delivery time

Well, in that case, I'm not calling.
No more.

Hello, the chicken with saliva from the restaurant is raw
I want to try tennis, but I’m afraid I can’t stick to it, so I want to find a similar price to practice.
Not friendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can not distinguish, then the normal situation is more expensive than cheap racket friendly, this kind of "entry racket" is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very strong, and the hard ball can’t withstand it, and it is difficult for the experts to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult that they know you won’t be able to learn it, and they also know that you won’t be willing to buy a more expensive racket, so they make a cheap racket to fool you, and after you play it twice, you won’t play it anymore, so the racket is cheap and you won’t feel bad about it.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means that you have made progress, and then you can come to me to buy the expensive ones, and I can earn twice the money.
It is recommended to spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand good racket, choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so the good racket is not sold at a high price. A new racket of 500 or 600 yuan is good. A second-hand racket of 200 yuan can enjoy the enjoyment of a racket of 1,000 yuan.
It’s friendly to newbies, but once you get past the newbie stage, it’s a chore, but most people, especially women, can’t get past the newbie stage.

In fact, there are many requirements for the dressing of plump girls.
Fat girls should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be about at the knee, just enough to cover the fat on the thighs.
A skirt that is too short will reveal fat on the legs.
Too long will make you feel short and fat.
If you divide the outfit into upper, middle and lower parts, it will make you look taller. For example, if you use different colors for the top, skirt and stockings, you will look slender.
In fact, many dark clothes are the standard equipment for chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this point), and dark colors are also a good way to hide your fat body. Elegant black skirts are also the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing dark colours, especially black skirts, can make you look slimmer.
If your calves are fat, don't wear socks or shoes that draw attention to them.
The more popular the better, and the colors shouldn’t be too bright.
So that when people look at your legs and feet, they don't feel fat.
For slightly chubby girls must talk about the tricks of dressing.
Don't wear tight skirts, and don't wear shirts that are too short or tucked into the skirt, which will make people feel uncomfortable. If your legs are thick, wear black stockings or mesh stockings (the kind with a fine grid), choose a soft print flared skirt, and wear a ruffled shirt, which can cover the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, chubby girls have their own requirements when it comes to wearing short skirts.
Fat girls wearing short skirts should choose tops that match the color of the skirt, which will make your fat body look taller.
Short skirt with high heels, can make your legs appear more slender, this is the most IN summer match oh!
If you are fat in the upper body but thin in the legs, it is recommended to choose a short dress with a gorgeous feeling.
Not only can it hide your belly, but it can also show off your strengths.
A-line skirts will make you look slimmer. They are more suitable for chubby girls. The top should be tight to create a sense of layering, which will make you look slimmer.
Simple white T-shirt with a skirt, fat MM can also try.
Chubby girls can also wear fashion.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing, plump girls will also be the focus of attention.
After the change in clothing, you should also exercise more in your life, and strive to get rid of the label of a chubby girl as soon as possible 😄

Girl Makes Herself a Target to Raise Money for Sister: "It’s Better to Think of It as a Minor Injury" - Xinhua Net
A girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a large wooden board with the words “human meat target, 10 yuan per arrow” written on it.
Yesterday morning, a photo of a “Hangzhou girl willing to be a ‘target’ to raise funds for her sister” went viral on Moments.
Photos show that a girl in Hangzhou Wulin Square stands in front of a large wooden board slightly taller than a person, on which is written "human meat target, 10 yuan per arrow", indicating that passers-by can use a bow and arrow after paying.
This behavior triggered heated discussions among netizens.
Last night, the person in charge of publicity of the Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the Beijing News reporter that the police confirmed that the girl made such an extreme move to raise money for her sister, but such behavior is not worthy of promotion. After being warned, the girl left the local police station yesterday.
Girl targeted in street fundraiser warned
In the picture, a long-haired girl stood in front of a large wooden board in the shape of a “ge” character. The wooden board was written with the words “human meat target, 10 yuan per arrow” in black ink. Another wooden board in front of her was written with her bank account number and WeChat and Alipay account numbers.
The picture caused controversy online.
Some netizens believe that this is a "begging behavior to attract attention", and many netizens also expressed their sympathy.
"We found the situation at about 10:00 a.m. on the morning of the 23rd when we patrolled the square. At that time, there were already a lot of people watching. "
When interviewed by the local media, the policemen from Tianshui Police Station near the scene said that there were two girls selling goods, both of whom were about 20 years old and dressed in a youthful and beautiful manner.
Among them, the girl who acted as a “human punching bag” was crying and begging passersby to play the game; another girl was helping to shout at the side, saying that her friend’s sister had leukemia and needed an urgent operation, so please help.
"We contacted the local police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising money for her sister's leukemia treatment. "
Last night, the publicity person in charge of Xiacheng Branch of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau told the Beijing News reporter that the girl’s name was Ji Jiali, and she was raising money for her sister Ji Jiayan.
However, since the treatment still required more than 300,000 yuan, he could not think of a good way to raise funds, so he did this.
He said that during the whole process, the two girls were used as targets and assistants, but did not participate in the process. No one was found shooting arrows during the whole process. Only some people watched and took photos and posted them on Weibo.
After the police were identified by the security department, the use of the bow and arrow does not belong to the scope of control.
The person in charge said, "It is not recommended to take this kind of eye-catching donation method".
After being warned by the police at the police station, she left the police station.

What's hot in 2021?
It is undoubtedly the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympians can win medals?
A while ago, there was a very popular article titled “Look! The Olympic Events in which Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals”. The article mentioned that project managers are definitely in the lead in many projects, and no one can match them: Moving bricks, going on business trips, staying up late are the daily routine of project managers, and putting out fires, taking the blame, and apologizing are nothing.
This article, which seems to be a joke, also reveals the daily bitterness of project managers, which represents the inability to cope with the current project management work.
And the people who work on the project management, also gradually choose to take some actions to get rid of the predicament in their work.
From the rising number of PMP (Project Management Professional) applicants each year, more and more project management practitioners are learning to improve their project management skills.
According to the China Project Management 20 Years Development Report (1999 - 2019), as of September 2019, the cumulative number of PMP® candidates in China was nearly 600,000, the number of PMP® holders was about 420,000, and the number of valid holders was about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of PMP® holders worldwide.
In the past 10 years, the number of PMP holders has increased year by year, which shows that more and more project managers realize that it is no longer feasible to do things by simply copying the "old experience" in the past. The ever-changing work environment makes us know that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants to explore the road ahead.
However, does passing the PMP guarantee smooth project management?
Many beginners in project management said that by learning PMP/IPMP and other related courses, they can systematically master the ten major areas and five process groups of project management and other related knowledge, but when they really do project management work, they are still confused.
Many project managers often feedback the following problems: Project management cognition is not in place, relying solely on personal experience, empty project management theory, do not know how to practice; Lack of systematic project management process system support, unable to land in the work, project forecast is not accurate, control degree sensitivity is poor, the project is delayed again and again; Member division is not clear, the "old oil" in the team do not know how to deal with cross-departmental assistance communication is not smooth, the project is difficult to promote......
Therefore, after more than ten years of focusing on product innovation and R&D management, Zhongtian Huaxia Consulting, which has helped many excellent enterprises to cultivate a large number of product managers, project managers and other key R&D talents, and won the honorary title of "China Enterprise R&D Management Talent Training Demonstration Base", has come with the online course "R&D Project Manager Training Camp".
R&D Project Manager Training Camp Online Course This is a way of online fragmented learning, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many R&D enterprises to help you master the essential knowledge and standard actions of a project manager and embark on the advanced path of your own project management.
This is also an opportunity for businesses to promote the development process of project managers at a lower cost and with less input, and to bring about efficient operation results for businesses.
The course is not only taught by the expert team of Zhongtian Huaxia (former Huawei R&D management team), but also combines the international advanced project management methodology and the real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises to explain the course content in a professional and easy-to-understand manner.
It will also provide scientific and practical management tools and methods, as well as rich templates and forms, to help trainees apply what they have learned to specific work after class.

Home Credit Advocates Rational Consumption for Consumers on the Eve of “Double 12” - www.eeo.com.cn - Professional Financial News Website
This year’s “Singles’ Day” shopping festival saw a record high of RMB1.77 trillion in online payment transactions nationwide.
The variety of reduced-price red envelopes and eye-catching live broadcasts have once again made consumers exclaim that they have benefited. This consumption boom has made people lament the increasingly strong national consumption power on the one hand, but on the other hand, they have to calm down and think about the impact of consumerism on society and the mainstream consumer groups of today.
On the eve of the "Double 12", Home Credit Consumer Finance Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Home Credit") issued a rational consumption advocacy, reminding the majority of users, especially young people, to establish a good sense of consumption and consumption habits, and refuse blind consumption and excessive consumption.
According to the results of the Consumer Financial Literacy Survey and Analysis Report released by the People’s Bank of China this year, the national consumer financial literacy index was 66.81, an increase of 2.04 compared with 2019.
Overall, the performance of China’s residents in financial consumption is good, but there are significant differences in different aspects of financial behavior and skills, and the level of basic financial knowledge needs to be further improved.
The financial literacy level of the elderly and teenagers is relatively low. "One old and one young" will still be the focus of financial education. The "China Young People's Debt Report" released by Nielsen and the "2019-20 China Youth Consumption Report" released by CCTV Finance show that the younger generation has great consumption potential. Credit consumption has become an important way to upgrade consumption. 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt accumulation. Although the younger generation as a whole shows a rational consumption trend, which is very different from the label of "excessive consumption" imposed by the outside world, some young people do have excessive consumption and herd consumption behavior, which has led to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even led to the gradual increase of social problems. Financial enterprises should be brave to assume social responsibility and guide in the right direction.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Home Credit has been committed to providing high-quality and intimate services to help people build their own happy life, advocating that consumers establish a good and correct concept of consumption, and actively responding to the call of supervision to enhance the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young people, with practical actions.
Over the past few years, Home Credit has continuously carried out comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities for young people, including college students, and through various forms such as innovation practice competitions in cooperation with top domestic universities, Home Credit has subtly guided the consumption demand of young people in a reasonable way, helped them establish a rational consumption concept, reasonably plan consumption demand, and then helped them accumulate wealth in their lives.
On the occasion of the Double 12 Shopping Festival, Home Credit reminds all consumers to establish reasonable consumption awareness and correct views on money, to resist blind consumption and excessive consumption, to avoid the pitfalls of consumer lending, so as not to affect personal credit and future economic life.
When consuming, we must plan in advance and repay according to our ability.
If overdue, the overdue record will be recorded in the personal credit report, which may have adverse effects on the future purchase of cars and houses and other economic life.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, we should also choose formal institutions and channels, and pay attention to checking whether the relevant institutions have business qualifications.
In the future, Home Credit will, as always, rely on its mature and reliable consumer finance system and constantly updated financial products to provide consumers with more demand-oriented and diversified services, continuously help the general public to improve their financial knowledge, help consumers to cultivate the concept of rational consumption and moderate borrowing, and be a lifelong trustworthy consumer finance partner for consumers.

Vietnam News - GCC Addresses Common Challenges
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stops include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It is noteworthy that this is the first visit of Crown Prince Mohammed to Qatar since the embargo imposed on Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies in mid-2017, which led to the Gulf diplomatic crisis.
In the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed a total embargo on it, accusing it of supporting terrorist groups and having close ties with Iran.
The diplomatic tensions severely affected the internal cohesion of the GCC and had a negative impact on the economies of the countries in the region.
Four Arab states have blockaded Qatar by land, sea and air.
The crisis was only resolved at the January 2021 Gulf Cooperation Council summit, when the Gulf states signed an agreement mediated by the US and Kuwait to move towards "unity and stability."
Saudi Arabia has reopened its border with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are leading efforts to restore relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors to the country.
The Gulf Arab states' reconciliation to restore ties with Qatar stems from the need to unite for the sake of national interests and regional stability and aims to address common challenges.
During the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince to Oman, the two sides agreed to open the first direct land route between the two Gulf neighbors.
The 725-kilometre-long corridor linking the two countries will facilitate the movement of citizens and the integration of supply chains.
Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) will invest $5 billion in Oman and the two countries' companies signed 13 memorandums of understanding worth $30 billion.
The Saudi crown prince's visit to the Gulf countries comes as Iran is negotiating with the world's major powers to salvage the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - an agreement that Gulf Arab states have denounced as inadequate to address Iran's missile program.
The Gulf countries have always regarded Iran as a long-term "rival" and regard Iran's nuclear program as a "threat" to regional security.
The Gulf states believe that failing to resolve the Iranian missile issue and failing to take action to curb Iran's activities in the region are flawed.
Direct talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran have taken place against the backdrop of the failure of the major powers' nuclear negotiations with Iran to meet the wishes of the Gulf States.
Its goal is to contain the escalation of tensions in the region.
This is one of the factors slowing down the economic growth in the GCC countries.
The upcoming GCC summit will be the first since the dispute between some member states and Qatar ended.
This is an opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess its diplomatic achievements in contributing to the restoration of GCC unity, while proposing measures to enable its member States to cooperate fully in order to address common challenges and contribute to the stability and development of the Gulf States.

Claimed to be the loudest supercar exhaust in the New Forest!
This time, our team has brought this car, which is the dream of many men!
It is the Lamborghini flagship supercar, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700 - 4!
The asking price is nearly two million ringgit, and the annual road tax is tens of thousands of ringgit. It has four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
Forget it. I don’t know. According to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h. It’s probably when the myvi only reaches 30km/h that the other car has already reached 100km/h, hmm.
The low body, the arrogant scissor doors, the huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine under the glass perfectly illustrate the Lamborghini style.
The description of the car does not need to say too much, just Google it. The editor has compiled some explanations that Google may not give!
Too much attention, where to go everyone is watching, very uncomfortable! (Actually a little cool)
1km fuel cost around RM1 (owner doesn't care)
Practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (as you can't climb out of the car and get stuck halfway out)
The engine was so loud that I was deaf when I got off (but it was awesome).
The car is too big. It will be very narrow when parked in a regular parking space. I am afraid of being hit by the car next door when it opens the door!
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (editor’s own words, nothing to do with the car owner, haha)
Don’t misunderstand, this video’s supercar is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot videos for your car, please contact us!

Let the University Spirit Resonate with the Spirit of the Times - Xinhua Net
The so-called university spirit refers to a series of educational concepts and value pursuits formed by a university in the course of its development, which is the soul of a university.
From ancient times to the present, the spirit of the university is essential to the development of politics, economy, culture, science and technology, and even the progress of a nation.
Since the birth of the first modern university in the world, universities have undertaken a unique mission different from other social organizations. For Chinese universities, which emerged in the autumn of national crisis, their spirit is deeply influenced by traditional culture and the changes of the times. They advocate the values of "bright virtue for the world, self-cultivation, governance and peace" and the patriotism of "strengthening the country through education".
At present, the trend of informatization and internationalization of higher education is becoming more and more obvious. The global education competition, scientific and technological competition, and talent competition are intensifying. As an important "supply side", the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
In particular, the introduction of the "Overall Plan for Promoting the Construction of World-class Universities and World-class Disciplines" not only demonstrates China’s confidence and determination to move from a major country in higher education to a powerful country in higher education, but also puts forward higher and newer requirements for the development of universities.
How to strive to become a world-class university in a short period of time, accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a number of world-class disciplines on the basis of a certain gap, and realize "overtaking in the bend"?
In addition to being confident in their goals, pathways and capabilities, universities should also give full play to three advantages: first, the advantage of being a latecomer, by continuously introducing outstanding academic talents from overseas and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities to achieve a significant improvement in academic standards and the quality of education; second, the advantage of culture, by inheriting the wisdom of Chinese civilization accumulated over 5,000 years, carrying forward and developing outstanding traditional culture, so as to gather strength, shape brands and enhance image; third, the advantage of system, by giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system, strengthening goal-driven, gathering consensus and working together, optimizing resource allocation, and providing a sustainable and solid guarantee for accelerating catching up with the world’s advanced level.
In particular, we should be aware that it is impossible to build world-class universities in the same mold. While playing to their strengths, universities must also highlight their individuality and characteristics.
The characteristics of running schools should not only have common Chinese characteristics, but also reflect the unique goals, traditions and resources of each school.
As for Zhejiang University, we have focused on highlighting three characteristics in our schooling: first, we have highlighted the characteristics of innovation and entrepreneurship talent training, built an integrated environment for cultivating talents through science and education integration and the combination of universities and enterprises, and formed a full-chain entrepreneurship education ecosystem; secondly, we have highlighted the features of interdisciplinary convergence, promoted the optimization and adjustment of the disciplinary system, created an institutional environment for interdisciplinary research, and actively cultivated cross-disciplinary emerging disciplines and landmark cross-disciplinary achievements; thirdly, we have focused on the characteristics of the schooling system and social services, carried out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerated the formation of the pan-Zhejiang University industry-university-research cooperation system.
In this process, it is particularly important to always adhere to the spirit of the university and let the spirit of the university resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the school motto of "Seeking Truth and Innovation", the common values of "Diligence, Virtue, Discernment, and Sincerity", and the common values of "Accepting Rivers, Enlightening Virtue, Opening Things to the People, and Planting My Country" jointly constitute the latest expression system of Zhejiang University spirit.
This is an important guarantee for the school to adhere to the correct direction of running a school and to continuously accumulate cultural height and cohesion of spiritual strength. It is rich in connotation and far-reaching in significance.
Among them, "Hai Na Jiang He" emphasizes the spirit of openness and inclusiveness, reflects the spirit of "the talents of the world are at my disposal", and is manifested in the absorption of the high-quality concept of running schools and educating people in world famous universities; "Qi Zhen Hou De" emphasizes the spirit of truth-seeking and benevolence, which means that while pursuing truth, universities should receive the refinement of virtue and the honing of personality; "Kai Wu Qian Min" embodies the spirit of reform and innovation, which includes the pursuit of new knowledge, scientific research innovation, and reform and development; "Shu Wo Bang Guo" emphasizes the spirit of patriotism and dedication, which means that universities should always be with the fate of the nation.
This series of spiritual concepts and value pursuits is the soul of Zhejiang University’s 120-year history.
"The wise listen to the unheard, and the wise see the unseen."
Chinese universities should further base themselves on the overall situation of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, profoundly grasp the era and historical mission of higher education, and accelerate the construction of world-class universities.
At the same time, adhering to humanistic care and independence and freedom, let the spirit of the university and the spirit of the times and the spirit of the nation interact with each other, so as to provide an inexhaustible driving force for the realization of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and the realization of the common ideal of mankind.

Guangxi college students can take up to 5 years off to start a business - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 19 (Reporter Zhang Ying) Recently, the reporter learned from the Department of Education of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that in the future, universities and colleges in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system, relax the length of time for college students to take a leave of absence, and extend the length of time for students to take a leave of absence to start a business by 2 to 5 years on the basis of the original academic system. The time for taking a leave of absence and starting a business can be regarded as the time for practical education.
In order to promote the innovation and entrepreneurship ability of college students, Guangxi’s education, human resources and social security departments have worked together to build a platform for entrepreneurship, build more off-campus practice teaching bases for college students, university science and technology parks, college students’ entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases, so as to provide external guarantees for college students’ entrepreneurship.
According to requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in colleges and universities should reach more than 3,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and more than 2,000 square meters for higher vocational schools.
The government encourages colleges and universities to set up innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and prioritizes the transfer of majors for students who perform well in innovation and entrepreneurship practice.
University teachers should spend at least two months in industry and enterprises every two years to improve their awareness and ability of innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Education Department of Guangxi Autonomous Region requires all colleges and universities in Guangxi to thoroughly implement the innovation and entrepreneurship training plan for college students, and strive to make every college student participate in an innovation and entrepreneurial training plan during their school period.
Universities should actively organize students to participate in innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at all levels, and provide financial support.
NEWS GOV-MO: UM honours seven outstanding individuals with doctorates

In his speech, Prof Yuk Yuen first extended warm congratulations and high respect to the seven outstanding individuals who were awarded honorary doctoral degrees. They have made extraordinary achievements in different fields and made outstanding contributions to the development of the country and the progress of the world. At the same time, Prof Yuk Yuen extended his most sincere blessings to the graduates and parents, and also expressed his sincere respect to the dedicated and excellent academic staff of the university.
Sun Yifeng, Professor of Lecture at the Faculty of Humanities of the University of Australia, said that Professor Liu Zunyi is a world-renowned economist, known for his outstanding academic achievements and forward-looking educational philosophy.
In addition to his achievements in economic development, economic growth and the East Asian economy, he is also a visionary education leader.
In short, he has excelled in many fields.
When reading Nakamura’s praise, Sun Yifeng said that Professor Nakamura is a pioneer of sustainable energy technology.
He was one of three recipients of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention of the blue light-emitting diode (LED).

As NFTs exploded into the mainstream, a new concept emerged in the crypto community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity had a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the pandemic began to earn a steady income in the game.
Axie Infinity is a pet breeding game based on blockchain technology. It integrates a variety of play styles, including NFT. It is currently the NFT project with the highest trading volume, which has exceeded US$3 billion.
TokenTerminal data shows that Axie Infinity makes more than $8.2 million in daily revenue, close to that of Honor of Kings.
On August 6 this year, Axie Infinity said that its daily active users had exceeded 1 million.
The popularity of Axie Infinity has brought a new “play-to-earn” model to more people. With the help of blockchain and smart contracts, players are no longer single characters. In addition to enjoying the fun and economic benefits of the game, they can also participate in the governance of the game ecosystem.
This agency is not bestowed by the game maker, but is guaranteed by blockchain technology.
Seeing a news about the share price of friends, my biggest feeling is that enterprises should choose the track, that is, the choice of investment target industry. First of all, we should choose the industry with large growth space, at least 100 billion market size; Secondly, we should choose the industry with good future growth, considering the industry with the best growth in 3-5 years; Finally, we should choose the industry with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the market size, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is flat or bumpy refers to the competitive landscape of the industry.
Come on the track!
The first thing in the new year is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout for 2022.
The tactic is to "do the things right," which means doing things right.
The strategy is to “do the right thing”, which is to do the right thing.
Strategy is about finding direction, and tactics are about implementation. There is space for strategic thinking above most tactical thinking.
For example, in addition to how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), you can think about whether to continue to deepen in the current field or extend horizontally (strategic thinking); for example, in addition to improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), how to improve the retention rate of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); in addition to improving the participation rate of activities (tactical thinking), consider how to set the correct activity KPI to achieve the correct activity goal, such as improving the participation rate of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and precise new customer acquisition; in addition to improving DAU (tactical thinking), consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
Celebrating its 12th birthday, Bitcoin has seen several milestones in 2021.
On September 7, the small Central American country of El Salvador made Bitcoin legal tender, the first time Bitcoin has been made legal tender in a country or region.
On October 12, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved for the first time in eight years the launch of a Bitcoin ETF by ProShares and its listing on the New York Stock Exchange, marking the landing of the first compliant Bitcoin futures ETF on the U.S. capital market and the further expansion of the investment exposure to cryptocurrencies.
From the perspective of the development of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is not the protagonist.
On November 14, 2021, Bitcoin underwent a soft fork upgrade called Taproot, which improves the anonymity of transactions on the Bitcoin network and reduces the data burden of transactions by changing the data structure of the block itself.

Asian-American Groups Complain of Admissions Discrimination at Yale and Other Ivy League Schools - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23rd (Reporter Xu Jianmei) On the 23rd, more than 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice, protesting against the discrimination against Asian applicants in the admission process of three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three American universities has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have "long-term and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admission process.
Zhao Yukong said that the research of Sanders and other scholars in 2014 showed that among the three universities, the admission rate of Asian Americans was the lowest among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
Data from the U.S. Department of Education also shows that Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students among all Ivy League schools, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they expected the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice to launch an investigation after filing the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian Americans in their recruitment.
They also expect the universities that have been accused to take the initiative to pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies for Asian Americans.
At present, the three universities that were complained have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was founded in 2015, when it complained about discrimination in Harvard University’s admissions, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint for procedural reasons.
In addition to Chinese American groups, the complaint was also filed by Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American education groups.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Zhangting Town, Yuyao City, Zhejiang Province from a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, after Mr. Lu discussed the details of the purchase of the factory with the family of the owner of the house, he transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit through bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the recipient on the receipt for the down payment on the purchase and sale of the factory, which stated, “If the buyer does not want to buy the factory, the down payment will belong to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell the factory, the down payment will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the contract for the purchase and sale of the factory within one week.”
However, the two parties failed to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory sale and the payment method, which led to the delay in signing the house sale contract.
Considering that the two sides failed to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Lin returned the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
It was hard to find a house that he liked. He paid the deposit and was ready to pay for the house. All he needed was to sign the contract. However, the seller refused to sell the house, which made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu sued Ms. Lin to Yuyao City People’s Court.
After hearing the case, the court believed that the failure of the two parties to finally sign a formal contract could not be attributed solely to the defendant, and should be reasonably presumed that the negotiations failed, so the case should not apply the penalty of deposit, and the defendant did not need to bear the liability of double return of the deposit.
After the first instance verdict, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer’s Reminder] It is necessary to exercise due diligence in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, the buyer should exercise due diligence, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied, and specifying the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to avoid disputes between the two parties when performing the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese) After the end of the "Democracy Summit" on Friday, the spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Saturday (December 11) that the United States held the "Democracy Summit for Leaders" was "to draw ideological lines, instrumentalize and weaponize democracy, to carry out anti-democracy in the name of democracy, to incite division and confrontation, and to divert domestic contradictions".
The Chinese government believes that "for a long time, the United States has imposed its political system and values on others, carried out 'democratic transformation', imposed unilateral sanctions, and instigated 'color revolutions', causing disastrous consequences.
"Democracy" has long been the "weapon of mass destruction" used by the US to interfere in other countries.
The summit is a fulfillment of a campaign promise by Biden.
The two-day meeting was held via video, with leaders from 111 countries invited, including Taiwan, but not China or Russia.
On the eve of the summit, China and Russia attacked the United States for its own democratic problems, saying it was not qualified to host such a summit.
Internationally and domestically in the United States, there have been doubts about the summit, such as the criticism that some leaders with authoritarian tendencies were invited, such as leaders of the Philippines, Poland, and Brazil, and that the Biden administration’s true intention was not to organize the summit for democracy, but for geopolitical purposes.
New German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also took part in the virtual democracy summit
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that "today's American-style democracy is sickly, and the problems of money politics, identity politics, partisan confrontation, political polarization, social division, racial contradictions, and the widening gap between the rich and the poor are getting worse". American democracy is a "game for the rich" based on capital.
U.S. President Biden said in his speech, "As the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, strengthen the guardrails of democracy, promote reform, achieve transparent accountability governance, and be more resistant to the forces of authoritarianism and shocks, as well as those who want to pursue power naked in front of the public interest. "
He stressed that democracy is not taken for granted, "We must constantly renew it from generation to generation, and in my view, this is the defining challenge of our time."
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights "face persistent and alarming challenges, and democracy needs fighters to defend it."
The U.S. pledged a year of action following the summit, including a $424.4 million initiative to strengthen democracy around the world and support independent news media.
The U.S. wants countries to make concrete, public commitments to improve their democratic systems ahead of a physical democracy summit planned for late 2022.
Biden said, "Let all of our countries implement our commitments and report on our progress next year."

Educational Thinking: How College Entrance Examination Helps “Top Students” and “Bottom Students” Find Their Place - Xinhua Net
Three students from Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to the university’s leaders to express their confusion about the university’s exams, as well as their requests to increase the difficulty of the exams, change the types of questions, and make the exams truly reflect the students’ actual levels.
Indeed, college entrance examinations have long been a “hot topic”.
In college campuses, students come from all over the world, with different abilities and levels of learning.
Different feelings are inevitable when assessing such a diverse group.
Of course, if the exam questions are of a single type, with a high rate of repetition, and the questions are too simple, it will inevitably create a completely different feeling.
Students who don’t study hard may be able to pass the exam by cramming, but if they try other methods, they may achieve twice the results with half the effort.
As a result, there are "poor students" who can pass the exam even if they don’t put in any effort, or even get high scores; and there are "excellent students" who never miss classes, do well in assignments and notes, and don’t score much higher in exams.
So, the students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University reflecting on the problems in the college entrance examination are not without reason. I believe that this situation also exists in other universities.
In this sense, we should give a thumbs up to the three students who wrote the letter.
In fact, those who have been to college are well aware that cramming for exams, thinking of various ways to “extract” exam questions from teachers, and seeking to set the scope of exams in order to get “key guidance” before exams is not uncommon, and even taking notes during exams and asking teachers for leniency after exams is not unheard of.
In the author’s opinion, as a teaching quality assessment guide, measuring whether a university’s exam is qualified or not depends more on teachers’ comprehensive grasp of teaching and learning, as well as the scientific formulation based on this.
After entering the undergraduate stage, the majors are subdivided, and many professional courses focus on basic knowledge.
There is no doubt that whether a student has mastered the basic knowledge of a subject is what the college entrance examination is designed to test.
Undergraduate knowledge is basically the basic theories and basic common sense of disciplines. In terms of knowledge points, the space for change is not large, and is basically fixed.
As some teachers said, "The basic knowledge of college mathematics that we learned 20 years ago is still the focus of study."
However, the basic knowledge points remain unchanged, which does not mean that the examination types are single and the questions are repeated.
In many universities, examinations are generally composed of question groups, which are then compiled by senior teachers of the subject, and the examination papers are also reviewed by all the teachers of the subject, which can to some extent overcome the situation of repeated questions.
But to make a set of questions in line with the reality of teaching and learning, the questions are based on the overall situation of students' learning, and the difficulty is normally distributed. It is also necessary to comprehensively grasp the teaching situation and comprehensively analyze the degree of students' learning, so that the examination topic can have a dynamic grasp of the difficulty and type, which can not only highlight the basic knowledge examination, but also take into account the ability examination, and at the same time, the type of question is innovative design.
Examination is the baton of university education. What kind of examination, students will have the corresponding preparation plan. In the long run, it will affect the effectiveness of university education.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University has attached great importance to the letter of recommendation for students, and has deployed a plan for rectification throughout the university.
Teaching units are required to organize teachers to carry out seminars and final examination self-examination, formulate examination questions and related systems, and strengthen supervision and inspection of the examination question formulation and review process, refine the assessment of grades, and strengthen the comprehensive assessment of all aspects of the course teaching.
From the mechanism to solve the single type of questions, repeated questions and other issues is the university examination needs to face the issues, of course, the need to introduce the corresponding system, but the work is precious in the daily, the need for teachers to master the teaching situation, not only to eat through the teaching content, but also to eat through the students’ learning situation, both sides eat through, teaching and learning will be better docking, the formation of a virtuous interaction, the examination will be more in line with reality, so that “academic achievers” and “academic losers” get what they want.

Mrs. Kim Photography (South Street Branch)
Before taking photos, because we didn’t arrange our time well, we changed the time twice. Consultant Lanlan patiently helped us arrange the time.
It was later shot on a sunny weekend.
The staff at Madame Tussauds, whether it be advisors, makeup artists or photographers, are superb.
It was the first time in my life that I officially made up. Wow, I can’t believe that I will become so beautiful one day, haha.
Xiao Jie and another girl (I’m sorry, I can’t remember her name) were very patient with makeup, and the makeup was very natural.
The outdoor scene was taken in Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was very good that day. I didn’t feel cold. When taking photos, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and headdresses from time to time. If there was a slight problem, he would immediately help us fix it.
The photographer was also very funny, and I had a great day.
When choosing photos, because I saw a lot of cases online, I didn’t want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we were choosing photos, really, there was no meaning of letting us add photos, and the 24 photos in the package were not added (I heard that my cousin, who took wedding photos at the same time as me, added more than 10,000 photos to the package of more than 7,000, and I was shocked at the time and was afraid that I would choose too many photos).
Today, the photos were retouched, and Lanlan sent them to me. I looked at two of them and thought they were not good. They immediately retouched them for me.
Compared with the photos taken by my sister in the past, I think our photos are really satisfactory. They are simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to take wedding photos at Xuanhan Golden Lady!
Package price: 3999 yuan
We sincerely wish you a happy and prosperous life!

3,200 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to lack of special anti-fake paper
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) - The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the beginning of October, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies due to the depletion of stocks of special anti-counterfeit paper, with a total of 3,200 people affected so far.
However, the director of the agency, Kairouanemous, assured that the information of all babies who had applied for birth certificates had been recorded in the system and would be issued when the security paper arrived next week.
He explained at a press conference in response to a report by a net media that Sabah Newspaper’s newsprint printing problems had lasted for 10 months.
He said the issue had been around for two months and Sarawak faced the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturers of special anti-counterfeiting paper are affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed arrival in our country. "
He explained that the security paper used for Sabah’s birth certificates was different from that used in other states, so it could not be borrowed from other states.
The latest batch of security paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing, according to Kairouan.
"The agency will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday, and immediately carry out the final stage of printing back in Sabah. It is estimated that it will take an additional 2 working days (December 20) to hand over to the applicants. "
"We will inform the applicants to go to the local branch to get the birth registration paper. "
He added that Sabah has issued 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
I've been waiting since 7:00.
Is that near?
I'm talking about food
I'm waiting across from #PRS_ORG# again

During the meeting, Kvesic spoke highly of China-Bosnia and Herzegovina relations and said that he visited China during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympic Games and was deeply impressed by China’s excellent organization work. He firmly believed that China has the ability to hold the Winter Olympic Games well in a special period. Bosnia and Herzegovina is very much looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games. The Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee is actively organizing to participate in the Games. Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes to take this opportunity to carry out more extensive exchanges and cooperation with China in the field of sports.
Ji Ping said that China and Poland have a special "Olympic bond".
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics was successfully held here. In two months, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also kick off, presenting a simple, safe and wonderful event to the world.
It is expected that the two countries will deepen exchanges and cooperation in the preparation for winter sports events and the training of athletes. The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue to play its role as a bridge. It will take the Beijing Winter Olympic Games as an opportunity to promote the continuous deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries, so that the people of the two countries can "move towards the future" together, and wishes the Bosnian and Herzegovinian athletes good results in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" award ceremony. Ji Ping, as a special guest, presented awards to the best young athletes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
A promotional video of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games was shown repeatedly at the event.

The State Council’s Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism Issues Documents to Strengthen the Prevention and Control of COVID-19 in Port Cities after 48-hour Negative Nucleic Acid Test Results and the Establishment of “Buffer Zones” - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters Dong Ruifeng and Gu Tiancheng) The State Council’s joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic in port cities, requiring that people leaving port cities along the land border (except those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) must have a negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours, and that people arriving in port cities along the land border must undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival.
According to the notice, the time frame for the above requirements is from the date that provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities determine the scope of port cities and announce it, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposed that port cities with conditions may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
According to the person in charge of the Disease Control and Prevention Bureau of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local economy, and there is frequent cross-border traffic between the two sides.
The implementation of the policy of differentiated management in different regions has changed from one line of prevention and control to two lines of prevention and control, which is expected to move the frontier forward, compress the risk of epidemic spillover, and achieve the greatest effect of epidemic prevention and control with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been a number of local outbreaks in China, all of which were imported from overseas through the port cities.
The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this exposed some localities’ inadequate epidemic monitoring and early warning, failure to implement the closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, the formality of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection and sterilization of cold chain items at each link, improper management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise response to the epidemic.
The notice requires that from 9 aspects, such as improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, efforts should be made to speed up the shortcomings and weaknesses of port city epidemic prevention and control, do epidemic prevention and control work scientifically and accurately without relaxation, and weave a tight line of defense against imported cases.
The notice emphasized that all port cities should synchronously study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control work with the people’s livelihood security work, publish and open the people’s livelihood security hotline, regularly investigate the potential risks in the supply and price of basic daily necessities, and promptly solve and proactively respond to the outstanding issues reported by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, and banners), cities (prefectures, states, and leagues), and municipalities directly under the Central Government where open land, water, and air ports are located. The specific scope will be determined by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government) according to the needs of pandemic prevention and control and will be announced in a timely manner.

Oil Tube Video Reveals the Truth of US Military’s 20-Year Bloodthirsty Killing Spree - Xinhua Net
(Video source: YouTube)
On December 11, a short documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the oil platform attracted widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States launched the war in Afghanistan in the name of "anti-terrorism", forcibly exported American-style democracy through the war, and committed various crimes against humanity for 20 years of militarism, bloodlust and indiscriminate killing of innocent people.
Abusing drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian sites, distorting human nature, and establishing killing teams.
For 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military set up "black prisons" to torture and humiliate "suspects".
One atrocity after another fuels the hatred of more Afghans.
As the video says, the American “anti-terrorism” war is “more anti-terrorism and more terrorism”.
The war has not brought peace, democracy and prosperity to the Afghan people. Instead, it has left the country in ruins and caused countless killings and destruction.
Watch the video and let’s expose the truth that the US is killing people in the name of “anti-terrorism” and the hypocrisy of American democracy!
Inadvertently saw the following article, from the perspective of business and preservation period to talk about why this customer to bonded area logistics company to do canning, although canning belongs to deep processing, does not belong to the scope of business of bonded logistics company, here as follows this text may explain why the customer wants to do so?
I have visited many milk powder manufacturers and come into contact with many milk powder production lines.
In fact, the raw materials of powdered milk in bags and cans are the same, and there is no difference.
So people will ask: Why is the shelf life of the bag one year, while the shelf life of the can is two years or more?
Or ask: Why is the price difference between canned and bagged so big?
In fact, many consumers, or mothers, believe that this is because the raw materials are different, so the quality will be much better.
In fact, the raw materials are the same, but everyone thinks that expensive is good.
There are also consumers with this mentality ate after the reaction said canned taste or taste is not the same!
First, let me tell you why it is expensive. Where is it expensive?
Why is the difference so great when the raw materials are the same?
Because most manufacturers consider that if the price of the bag is too high, it is difficult for consumers to accept, which means that the profit generated by the manufacturer is very low, or even no profit, then what does the manufacturer live on?
So they have a big increase in the price of canned goods to secure their profit margin.
As a result, most manufacturers focus on cans rather than bags.
And you want so many manufacturers to spend tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of yuan on advertising every year. Where does this money come from?
You can imagine.
So with the development of society, the marketing expenses, such as: shopping mall promotion personnel, shopping mall display costs, product gifts costs, advertising costs are also increasing.
Therefore, manufacturers are also constantly increasing new products, and they are canned, and their prices are also constantly rising. In fact, this is a new product with the increase in market expenses.
The main purpose is to obtain higher profits, in fact, their raw materials increase the cost of no more than 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, do not hesitate to link up with doctors in hospitals, and have them assist in the promotion of their products. The profits range from 30 yuan to 80 yuan per can.
And China’s relevant laws absolutely do not allow such methods of operation. In fact, this practice is harming consumers.
It is recommended that people buy powdered milk in bags and put it in cans at home, which can save costs and increase the preservation and sealing of powdered milk, and has no impact on children.
Also, do not think that the shelf life of canned goods is longer than that of bagged goods. If the shelf life of canned and bagged goods is the same after opening, it is only that the shelf life of bagged goods is not easy to preserve after opening and is prone to moisture and deterioration.
The food was cold, and after it was cold, it was dry and hard, and completely inedible.
And the sauce spilled out

Don’t scare people off at the starting line - Xinhuanet
When browsing the book market, you can often feel the popularity of books on success.
Many of today's success books preach the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do.
In other words, it bypasses the most important and fundamental step of “how to do it”.
That's why all of these books have one thing in common - they're either all in or they're all out; they're either 100% or they're 0%; they're either climbing Mount Everest or they're standing still.
This "best principle" makes everyone who sees it admit that it is "perfectly correct", but 99% of people will be scared to death at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you have to make up your mind, start over, and make a 180-degree turn," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For a person who is rigid, conservative, and refuses to change, it is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the flute to the ox to shout at his ear, "You must change."
The vast majority of people are afraid of the word “change” and hesitate to make a decision; or they make the decision to “change” on the spur of the moment and take the first step bravely, but it is often short-lived, and they can’t stick to it for long.
Mr. Ma Sanli’s famous crosstalk “From Tomorrow On” is the most vivid expression of this “universal human nature”.
The biggest problem of the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limit of the ability of ordinary people, so that the vast majority of people "sigh at the door".
Perhaps the "second best principle" is a way to let more ordinary people take the road to relative success.
The core of the "second-best principle" is "reducing the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories into big victories", that is, if you can’t do 100, do 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can’t climb Mount Tai, climb the small sand dune in front of your house, because it’s always better than standing still.
In short, as long as you do something, it is always better than nothing.
Because the threshold has been greatly reduced, there is more possibility for ordinary people to stick to it, and as long as they stick to it, the probability of success will also increase.
It's just that the road to success following the "second-best principle" is a little longer.
To sum up, the "best principle" can only motivate a few people in the end, although it is in the name of making everyone successful, but the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

Qinghai Lake naked carp resources increased by 0.71 million tons this year - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei and Zhang Hongxiang) The reporter learned from the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs that the latest monitoring results show that the resources of Qinghai Lake naked carp this year increased by 0.71 million tons over the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons, and compared with the early period of protection in 2002, the cumulative growth is more than 40 times.
The common name of Qinghai Lake naked carp is "Huangyu", which is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of Qinghai Lake naked carp decreased sharply due to human hunting, the deterioration of the environment in the breeding waters of naked carp, and other factors. In 2002, the reserves of Qinghai naked carp were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Species in China.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the policy of sealing the lake to breed fish, prohibiting any units, collectives and individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and the main rivers and tributaries of the lake, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and their products.
At the same time, Qinghai Lake’s naked carp resources have increased year by year through artificial propagation and stocking, as well as measures such as cleaning the main rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable “fish passageways”.
Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said that to date, Qinghai Lake naked carp have been artificially propagated and released for nearly 180 million, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake naked fish resources.
The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan region is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even in Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan region and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued notices banning fishing in key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive fishing ban management system of “one river, one river, one lake”.

I just saw an article about menstruation. It was too long.
Let’s educate the men who don’t know.
Most girls will have their first period sometime between the ages of 13 and 15, and will go through menopause around the age of 50.
After that, under the premise of good health, it will come regularly every month.
However, it is not regular enough to be accurately predicted. There is a margin of error of about a week, so it needs to be prepared in advance. Sometimes, bad luck will cause a derailment (suddenly several days ahead of schedule).
The length of time, the amount of blood, and the degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person. Some people have it for three days, some people have it for a week; some people have a light period, some people have a heavy period; some people have no reaction, and some people are in so much pain that an ambulance has to be called. Dysmenorrhea changes over time, and just because it wasn’t painful in the past doesn’t mean it won’t be painful in the future.
Menstruation is uncontrollable, bleeding 24 hours a day for a few days from start to finish, and the only thing that can be done is to use sanitary napkins or tampons to suck the blood to prevent it from flowing on clothes and chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly caused by the secretion of prostaglandin. If you take ibuprofen before the dysmenorrhea starts, it can effectively relieve the pain of the month. It is useless to take ibuprofen after the dysmenorrhea begins.
Menstruation is prone to diarrhea due to uterine congestion and excessive release of prostaglandins.
If you get diarrhea for no apparent reason around the time of your period, you will probably get your period within two days.
It is best to change sanitary napkins every two to three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria. Except for sleeping time, the worst case is to change 6 times a day, 7 days a month, that is 42 pieces, and if you prepare in advance, there may be 50 pieces, not one a month.
(Here is a modification, tampons do not need to be changed often, about five or six hours to change once, up to eight hours)
During menstruation, hormones may make you more irritable, and during ovulation, hormonal changes in the body may make you emotionally unstable, which is very unfortunate, because the body trips itself.
But official crime statistics show that women's ability to control their emotions is still very high and they do not use emotional problems as an excuse.
It's not just the blood that comes out, it's the shedding of the lining of the uterus.
The endometrium is the thinnest after menstruation, and then gradually thickens. It can be understood that the uterus is a house, and every month the house is built (endometrial thickening) to prepare for guests. If the guests do not come, the whole house is demolished (menstruation) and a new house is built next month, and so on.
Menstruation is very inconvenient. It bleeds 24 hours a day for a few days every month for decades. It also causes abdominal pain and back pain. Who wants that?
But a person can be born because his mother has menstruation, menstruation is to prepare for you to come to the world for the first time to live 10 months of the house, we should thank their mothers regular and healthy menstruation.
A lot of things were suppressed for women in the past. Society brainwashed women into believing that they were dirty and shameful. People thought that was the way it was, but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, that the preparation of the female body for life is disgusting, it should not be said in public. Girls, stand up and stop thinking so. Never experienced, will not experience in this life, and do not understand men, do not be so ungrateful, how can you face your mother with this attitude, how can you want your child?
Finally, sisters, try tampons, they really work.
Today is the Winter Solstice Festival. It's disappointing to send the wrong one.
We need to order something special for the kids.
Hope the shop will check the output in the midst of the rush
Is the foot bath jar numb because of electric leakage?
Choosing the right foot bath basin can play a good role in foot massage health care. Today, Gome editor will answer this question, hoping to help friends.
With the enhancement of people’s health awareness, foot bath basin is more and more popular among consumers. A large number of products of different grades have emerged in the market. From more than 100 yuan to more than 1,000 yuan, foot bath basin is dazzling, giving consumers a lot of choice.
According to relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of health care appliances such as foot baths are booming, but foot baths do not have a special industry standard, so there are certain safety risks.
“It’s too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!”
Mr. Li told the reporter that recently, he bought a foot bath basin as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when he soaked his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he did not expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness on the bottom of his feet.
Mr. Li tried the electric pen, and the electric pen turned on. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was electrified.
Later, he contacted the store, and the store’s attitude was good. Although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this has been popular for a long time foot bath basin now in the highest temperature setting, applicable to what kind of people, what kind of materials to ensure harmless and so on do not have a clear and detailed industry regulations.
However, in general, foot bath basins will not have electricity problems, but it is not ruled out that a few products do not strictly control at the time of production.
Therefore, choose a separate foot bath when purchasing.
Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take the electric pen to measure.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headlines - Hunan Daily - Voice Online
Hunan Daily, December 10 (reporter Zhang Shangwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Recommendation Meeting was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showing the tea industry, innovating tea science and technology, carrying forward tea culture, and accelerating the sprint to the goal of 100 billion tea industry.

Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that deals with questions that cannot be answered by the senses.
Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the basic nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of "metaphysics" comes from the sentence "the metaphysical is called the Tao, and the physical is called the tool" in the Book of Changes. It was translated by Japanese philosopher Tetsujiro Inoue (Meiji era) from metaphysic.
Branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology, and related questions.
Ontology is "the study of what nouns represent real entities and what nouns represent concepts".
Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis is the idea that all phenomena can be explained in terms of natural causes, and it is advocated by philosophers who support science and evolution.
Methodological naturalism, on the other hand, refers to a research method that makes no mention of God.
Philosophy of mind is the branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind and its relationship to the body, especially the brain.
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought that discuss the relationship between mind and body.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature, origin, and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is the branch of philosophy that systematically considers and studies human moral life; here morality is defined as the set of rules of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is divided into meta-ethics (the abstract study of the nature of ethical theory or criticism) and normative ethics (the evaluation of various moral views and the provision of normative advice on what is right or wrong to do).
It studies what kinds of moral rules people should follow), applied ethics (the academic study of applying ethical theories to real-life situations, including bioethics and political ethics), and descriptive ethics (gathering information about how people live and drawing conclusions from observed patterns).
Rather than starting from a presupposed theory, it examines actual choices made and observed by moral agents, the moral factors that contribute to those choices, and the ethical views held by social groups.
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part 1: The ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
Part Two: The ethical thought of the Reformation, represented by Calvin.
Part III: Ethics of Politics, represented by Machiavelli and others, modern ethics (17-18 centuries, British empirical ethics, represented by Hume, 17-18 centuries, Continental rationalist ethics, represented by Spinoza, 18 centuries, French Enlightenment ethics, represented by Voltaire, 18-19 centuries, German academic ethics, represented by Kant and Hegel, 18-19 century, British utilitarian ethics, represented by Bentham and Sidgwick, 19 century, British evolutionary ethics, represented by Spencer and Huxley, late 19 century, German neo-Kantian ethics, represented by Rickert, late 19 century, neo-Hegelian ethics, represented by Thomas Hill Green, etc.)
Logic is the study of "the principles and standards of valid reasoning and proof."
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and non-formal logic.

Yang Xingca, whose real name is Jiang Bo, was born in the Year of the Goat in the Month of the Goat, and was born on the grass of the goat, so he was called "Yang Xingca".
He is known in the industry as a "mystery prodigy" for publishing works such as "Strange Tales of Thailand", "Strange Tales of India", "Strange Tales of Japan" and "Strange Tales of Korea" in the "Otherland Code" series. He calls himself "good at talking nonsense seriously"
“The Darkness Beneath the Light”, also known as “China’s Strange Stories”, “Suspense Genius” Yang Xingca takes you deep into the marrow of Chinese folklore with his new work “The Darkness Beneath The Light”. What kind of tragic and moving love and hate is behind the legends that have been passed down to this day?

Ding Zilin: To a Friend.
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance during the long period of more than 30 years since the death of my family members, particularly since I appealed to my friends at home and abroad for humanitarian assistance in my own name in early 1994.
Most of the victims’ elderly parents have passed away, and the orphans have grown up, married, and found employment.
It was your generosity that helped us get through the most difficult time of our lives.
With the COVID-19 pandemic raging around the world, most donors are also retirees.
Therefore, I earnestly request you to suspend the humanitarian donations to the families of the victims - the Tiananmen Mothers group. This humanitarian assistance should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will always remember your love, and I am sure that your righteous deeds will be remembered by history.
For various reasons, I can only express my will in this way, please friends understand!
Please accept my sincere best wishes.
Allow me to take this opportunity to give a brief introduction to the 32-year history of humanitarian assistance by the International Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars (IFCSS) and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation (MCDF).
In the process of humanitarian assistance, the National Association of Chinese Students and the Minnesota China Democracy Foundation are parallel organizations, and the project executors often overlap.

Relief funds often fail to reach the hands of the victims of June 4.
In 1994, at the suggestion of Mr. Ding, a special group was established by the "Tiananmen Mothers" to coordinate and manage the receipt and distribution of humanitarian aid.
In 1998, MCDF set up the "Education Fund for 64 Orphans", and after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the 64 orphans graduated from university, MCDF set up the "Special Hardship Relief Fund for 64 Lonely Elderly People", and has been implementing it until now.
Funding for these projects came primarily from campus and community donations in 1989, from the generosity of individuals, and from the support of the Foundation for Democracy at Brother Universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Gulag Research Foundation.
Until last year, after a lapse of 31 years, the families of the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre finally received a portion of the donations collected in Hong Kong in the name of the Tiananmen Massacre.
In the meantime, Human Rights in China has also been independently carrying out its humanitarian projects.
We understand that Teacher Ding stopped the donation for the donors’ consideration. We are indeed some retired old people, and our income is not as abundant as before retirement. Therefore, we would like to express our gratitude to Teacher Ding for his “Letter to Friends”.
We will respect the families' decision to end the project within two years and to reactivate it if necessary.
Thanks and respect are also due to those gallant souls who, over the years, have risked their lives to deliver humanitarian aid.

Thank you for your comments. I originally said that rejecting the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style, but I did not expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you for Dandan’s recognition, your satisfaction can make us full of electricity to continue forward, we will continue to refuel!
This photography studio is really great. Highly recommend all my friends to come here!
There was nothing wrong with the reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography, and post-production.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous, and will match the makeup to your style. The cosmetics used are all first-tier brands.
As for teacher Tian Liang, his photography is quite professional.
The whole studio is very artistic, and there are two little cats to play with.
We work in Beijing, and the better photo studios in Beijing need to be booked six months in advance. Some of my colleagues have taken photos in Beijing, and after seeing the photos, I think they’re just so-so.
I specially looked for this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is poor, and we think this is the shortcomings of most people. The photographer Liang Ge will snap and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a well-trained team.
When it came out, we and the people around us all praised it.
I've already recommended it to my best friend, and she was just as delighted when she saw the negatives.
It is hoped that such studios will not be overlooked, and that more people will discover them and shoot their own style, rather than the same old thing.
Thank you very much for Zhan Ying and Jingling’s five-star reviews. Both of them are very creative and innovative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as customers like it, we will do our best to complete it. Thank you for meeting us.
Sweet and caring assistant, and lively and cheerful photographer teacher, everyone in the team is super nice. A wonderful shooting, a memorable experience, and the effect of the shooting is much better than I expected. Thank you all for your hard work.
Thank you for your comments. It is a kind of fate to know you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, our trust is thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to know you. I will come to Qinhuangdao to play next time.

If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to train. But if you don’t have this idea, it is better to learn by yourself. After all, the money spent on training is a lot, and it takes 6 months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-control, training is a very good choice.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to study on your own, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
First of all, we should look at the faculty of the institution. If the faculty is not strong enough, the training institution will have no meaning. Of course, the faculty of some newly opened training institutions is not particularly strong.
Secondly, find out about the training institution before making a choice. It is best to find out about the students from the institution. After all, only the students from the institution know how good or bad the courses are.
Hello, in fact, your question I do not know how to answer, because for your own situation did not do a certain introduction, and learning this thing and personal situation has a great relationship.
Such as major, age, language you want to learn, even which city, these will be related to your learning or want to engage in the industry.
If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you are a computer professional who has graduated, then if time is sufficient, I personally recommend self-study, which is the most efficient and cost-effective. Now, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time invested is more, basically need to focus on training for 3-6 months.
But if it is what I said, self-study is very convenient. Many learning resources on the Internet are free, or you can go to Bilibili for a lot of training resources. If you don’t know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the profile to get free resources, or for detailed consultation.
There are also some more classic books that can be studied in conjunction with the videos.
If you are not a computer major, but can also pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, then it is recommended to go to a training institution to learn. In this way, learning is not very difficult, the teacher explains in detail, and there are people to answer questions. In addition, it is also helpful in learning planning or supervision.
And now many training institutions will sign employment agreements, there are internal referral quotas, after learning to recommend to the company, so the back-end job interview can also save a lot of things.
The above is my point of view. Because I don’t know your situation, I can only introduce it roughly and not in detail. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication.
I said I'd be there by 1. I saw it on the app.
What's that?
I haven’t finished, what are you doing?
I, undertake all kinds of (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-mounted boiler water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioning, toilet, stove, smoke machine, lighting installation, window cleaning, professional grouting, housekeeping services
Thank you to those who silently like my posts. Life is hard, but we must keep going.
Life will not disappoint every person who works hard. If you like me, please follow me. Thank you to those who silently like my post.
Life is like this, others only look at the results, and you alone support the process. Faced with life, in addition to being strong, we have no choice but to continue. We can look back at the road, but we can’t go back.
Cleaning is a job, but also a duty. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is wonderful because of care.
Cleaning Although we do the dirtiest work, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer’s home. Seeing the customer’s satisfied smile and thumbs up, that moment is worth all the hard work!

To succeed, you must put your heart into it. To create beauty, you must be meticulous. We are serious about caulking.
Give me a chance, I will make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is trustworthy, and your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
At present, all walks of life are not easy to do!
But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, enough persistence, and enough hard work, I will be better than others, at least it is better than sitting and complaining. "
A day's plan is in the morning, all the good things start from the morning I hope you carry the happiness, luck, health, wish to start a new day, keep a good mood all day long Good morning
When I was a child, happiness was a thing; when I grew up, happiness was a goal; when I became mature, I found that happiness was a state of mind; when I understood, I was happy.
Be the most real and kind of yourself, according to the heart, no regrets in this life; life is a road, walk your own way; life two treasures: good health, good mood, beautiful live to the old!
Every stage of life presents different challenges.
Many times, it is not your ability that holds you back, but the courage to face it.
If you can’t avoid it, embrace it.
The more afraid you are, the more you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you face up to them, the problems will eventually be solved.
Chinese and Saudi curators co-host Saudi Arabia's first contemporary art biennale - Xinhua
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporter Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan) The first Contemporary Art Biennale in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art District in northwest Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other places participated in the exhibition.
This biennale is jointly curated by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and China’s UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, with UCCA’s director, James Turrell, as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is "Crossing the River While Touching the Stones", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of socio-economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of the development of Saudi society and culture.
The biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, and the exhibition halls span six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Crossing the River While Touching the Stones", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Thinking at the Margins", "Going to the Public", "Brave New World", and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art and performance art and other forms; the works of 12 Chinese artists were also of great concern. Some artists used recycled materials in novel ways to create works, such as Xu Bing, who reconstructed a classic landscape painting with waste materials in "Behind the Story Series - Endless Stream and Mountains" (2014).
Barkley, CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, said he hoped that the biennale would establish an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to learn about Saudi Arabia’s thriving cultural industries and creative communities, and strengthen exchanges.
Tian Feiyu said, "The goal of the Biennale is dual-pronged. It not only allows Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, but also allows Saudi audiences to integrate into the contemporary art world."
It is understood that a series of lectures will also be held during the opening period of the Biennale, and artists, curators and thought leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchanges and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing management of rural public welfare positions - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter: Lin Bi-feng) - In order to continue to do a good job in employment assistance for people who have shaken off poverty and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province has recently introduced relevant policies to promote the management of rural public welfare positions for rural revitalization, so as to help comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare posts for the employment of rural disadvantaged groups such as poverty-stricken labor force, which play an important role in helping the poverty-stricken people to achieve employment and income, consolidating the results of poverty alleviation and effectively enhancing the capacity of rural public services.
The new regulations, jointly issued by seven departments including the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, the Department of Rural Revitalization, and the Department of Finance, are mainly aimed at unifying and standardizing the scope of applicants for rural public welfare positions, capital management, position development, and position management.
In terms of job development and setting, the new regulation clearly stipulates that job development and setting shall be carried out in accordance with the principles of "setting posts according to needs, determining people according to posts, dynamic management, and total quantity control", "whoever develops, whoever uses, and whoever is responsible", and "one post for one person, voluntary publicity, and unified management".
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, examination, publicity, employment, pre-employment training and assignment.
In addition, the new regulation also clarifies the specific responsibilities of the main development departments of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and subsidy methods of rural public welfare posts. It stipulates that the rural public welfare posts development departments should buy commercial insurance for accidental injury for the personnel of rural public welfare posts; and requires the relevant departments to supervise the issuance of rural public welfare posts subsidies on a regular basis.
Wrong address
Hello
Can I cancel my order?
I re-ordered
Has it been cancelled?
2. Although the rightists have had a time of success in history, it is not long, so short because a little sunshine is bright, drink a little boiled water and sweat; a little success will get longing for Shu, hit will be attached to the hair.
But to be fair, the right wing has played a positive role in social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution to defining the criterion of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting administrative institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right wing should not be denied.
3. As far as I am concerned, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I care about his statements and respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he is serious about China’s social problems.
But I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I think that anti-necessary revolution, revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, the people's livelihood is damaged, the political groups are mixed up with mud and sand, and then foreign countries take advantage of it.
4. To change or improve China, we must have patience and be responsible for the country and the people. Those who try to make political gains at the expense of others are not rightists, but bastards.
Let's talk about the left.
Left, in fact, is a bunch of outcasts of time and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will listen to some rightist speeches and analyze their thoughts when needed, but the left has no such fortune, because the left wants what the Communist Party has thrown away!
5. Recently, I saw some friends arguing with the rebels while refuting the left lunatics, and they were quite serious. I don’t think it’s necessary.
Don’t try to reason with the traitors and the left-wing lunatics. They’re both stubborn, and there’s no point in reasoning with them.
Don’t try to prove that we are right, and don’t try to make the rebels and the left-wing lunatics admit it. Why bother?
I told my friends: When the rebels call you a 50-cent, when the left lunatics call you a right dog, it proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people have ideals in their youth, but when they grow old, they forget their ideals, or they pursue their ideals and become obsessive.
And the ideal is getting further and further away, and even the dragon slayer becomes a dragon.
I think it generally refers to constraint and freedom. China’s historical and cultural genes lead to the fact that China as a whole should lean to the left.
Domestically, the right emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left emphasizes regulation and fairness.
Nowadays, the society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are competing, and it is certain that the left will prevail. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I can’t understand it, just like it.
Nothing to say, Hua Hua is so righteous
In the past two years, the blockade and encirclement of Huawei’s chips by the United States has not only plunged Huawei into an unprecedented predicament, but also caused huge losses for “American-style” enterprises.
The United States suppresses China’s chip industry and requires its own enterprises and the relevant enterprises of its allies to block China’s chip industry at the same time. The direct consequence is that the orders and profits of global chip suppliers are affected, resulting in the reduction of R&D investment and production capacity of chip manufacturers, thus causing the shortage and disruption of the global chip supply chain.
Now, the “chip shortage” has affected all major industries around the world. For example, automobile manufacturers have stopped production, and mobile phone prices have risen. Nearly all industries that use chips have been severely affected.
In order to master the “chip” autonomy, the technology giants of more and more countries have embarked on the road of “de-Americanization”.
In order to firmly grasp the control of the global semiconductor industry and restrain the development of China’s semiconductor industry, the United States has been making frequent moves recently, such as hosting the "Chip Summit" and inviting 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance, and allocating funds to support US technology giants. For example, the US technology giant Intel, in order to regain its dominant position in the chip industry, invested US$20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, USA, and opened its chip foundry business to the outside world.
When most people think that Intel’s move will cause a certain impact on TSMC and is likely to steal TSMC’s “lunch”.
This is because Intel, as an old technology giant in the United States, has been deeply involved in the semiconductor industry for decades, and has a large number of talents and technological reserves. It is certain to rise rapidly in the short term and defeat TSMC.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, the founder of TSMC, scorned Intel’s decision.
At the "2021 Master Think Tank Forum" held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising statement. He said frankly without hesitation that Intel’s move to build a wafer factory was quite ironic: Intel built a chip foundry.
The reason why Zhang Zhongmou is quite disdainful of Intel’s foray into the wafer field is that Zhang Zhongmou is still resentful of a grudge between TSMC and Intel more than 30 years ago.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel was a pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, ranking first in the world, and was the world leader in the semiconductor industry.
By the 1980s, the world’s high-end semiconductor chips were dominated by a handful of strong players.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by the IDM model. The design, manufacturing and packaging and testing of chips were all completed by a single factory. Intel was the representative of that era.
However, such a model is a heavy burden for some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs are deterred by the huge cost of building production lines.
Under the inspiration of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the chip industry began to appear the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation. In 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there was a company specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there was a company specializing in design, then a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou’s idea became a reality, and TSMC was born.
TSMC has focused its main business on the “wafer processing” single link. It does not design, but only provides foundry services for wafer manufacturing.
At that time, the newly founded TSMC was a small fry in front of the giant Intel.
In order to obtain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once sought investment from Intel, but when Intel heard that TSMC only did the manufacturing link of the chip industry, it was obviously arrogant and looked down on TSMC, and resolutely refused to invest in TSMC.
Zhang Zhongmou also believes that Intel at that time looked down on wafer processing services.
Unexpectedly, the giant that despised the wafer manufacturing service in the past will also begin to do wafer foundry.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou felt that it was ironic for Intel to enter the foundry business.
TSMC is now worth more than Intel.
In the face of TSMC’s strong offensive, Intel is naturally not daring to rest on its laurels.
Today, TSMC is racing towards 3nm chips, while Intel is still stuck at 14nm, seven years ago.
Catching up is not easy.
No more waiting
It's been 2 hours since I ordered at 19:06 😅
Today, let’s take a look at some “strange trending topics”.
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly pick three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Raising Its Head, Orion Price Increase, Lalamove Incident. The public opinion spreads to form a wave peak, and then the [index decline] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates. If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small hump again.
They look almost identical to the “evolution model of online public opinion” that the Cyberspace Administration of China once displayed on its official website.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly picking six hot search terms from the same event shows a peak, a zigzag, and a cliff.
The “isolated peak” refers to artificial heating, which quickly ranks on the hot search list and attracts public attention; the “sawtooth” refers to periodic heating, which ensures that the topic occupies the hot search list; the “cliff” refers to the collective withdrawal, which means that the hot search has played its “function” and received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, and the timing is not off by a second. It must be that a unified batch of water army received the task and launched a new round of attacks.
The professionalism of black PR can be seen from the following: dozens of hot searches are on the list at the same time, which attracts attention, which is responsible for popular science, which attracts war and momentum, which shifts attention, which affects cognition, which misleads judgment, which incites emotions, which involves decision-making, and black production accounts fight in batches and nodes, and almost consider all the elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science. Putting aside all subjective factors such as positions and emotions, only objective data can expose black public relations.
Wherever you go, you will leave a trace. Let’s dig it out together.

First Cases of Omicron Variant Found in Mauritius and Other Countries - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12 According to reports from Xinhua News Agency’s foreign correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant on the 10th.
According to the Minister of Health of Mauritius, Kailash Jagutpal, one of the infected persons was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27, and the other was a local resident of Mauritius who tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30 after contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa.
After hospital isolation treatment, the nucleic acid test results of the two infected persons turned negative, and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country had confirmed its first three cases of the Omicron variant.
All three are students who returned from overseas trips earlier this month and were not hospitalized due to mild symptoms.
In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Serbian government has been increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6 to January 10 next year, passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by air will need to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health also announced on the 10th that it would begin to vaccinate children aged 5 to 11 in the country with Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine.
On the 9th, the Minister of Health of Malawi, Kumbez Chiponda, said that the country had discovered three cases of infection with the Omicron variant for the first time.
The country's health department conducted genomic sequencing of 12 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and discovered the three cases of infection.

Damei 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Address: 12th Floor, Happiness Home, No.156, Huancheng South Road
At first, I was introduced by a friend. Because of trust, I chose to take a look. At first, my budget was 70,000 yuan for basic decoration.
They come into the store and start a series of scams.
I am the first time to the store just showed them my floor plan, they did not go to the field to measure the house, they can give me a quote that my 135 house 70,000 can be done, gave me a general look at their materials and do not know what brand of materials they are.
Their second scam is that as soon as you walk into the store, they will drag you to pay the deposit (and once you pay the deposit, you can never get it back unless you have enough experience to fight with them).
When I was hesitating to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you how much discount.
This is a big pit. I am a living example of being cheated. I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan in a fit of impulse.
The offer he gave me had a lot of problems. 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets, bathrooms, and these three are the bulk of the cost of basic installation.
Apart from that, their service charges are higher than other companies.
I lost trust in the company. They didn’t tell me anything from the beginning.
When I went to get my money back, they acted like they knew what they were doing, with special little teams to deal with you.
It's always the customer's fault, no matter what.
All kinds of shirking responsibility, and there are many details, do not want to say are tears, in short, do not choose them, because my friend found them to decorate the house is also poor quality, later to you count all kinds of costs.
It’s a scam. They used to be the leading decoration company, but now they’ve changed their name to Damei, and it looks like they’ve gone bankrupt and changed their name again.
So don’t choose such a scamming decoration company.
In the future, when you choose to look at Baidu to see these consultations, because the decoration is not a small amount of money.

Geminid Meteor Shower Peaks on the 14th - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12 (Reporter Zhou Runjian) According to experts in astronomy and popular science, as the last major meteor shower of the year, Geminid Meteor Shower, one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, will reach its peak on December 14. Fans of meteor showers can observe it in the second half of the night.
Beijing amateur astronomer An Zhu took this photo of the Geminid Meteor Shower in Qinghai on December 13, 2018.
Most meteor showers originate from periodic comets, but the Geminids originate from 3200 Phaethon, an Apollo asteroid.
The Geminids are also known to be the second meteor shower that is not associated with a comet.
According to Xiu Lipeng, director of the Tianjin Astronomical Society and an expert in astronomy popularization, just like the New Year’s Eve blockbusters, the Geminid meteor shower usually appears at the end of the year. The "release period" can last from December 4 to 17.
This meteor shower is known for its large and steady flow, and is known as one of the three major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere, along with the Quadrantids and the Perseids.
A distinctive feature of the Geminid meteor shower is that the meteors are slow-moving, colorful, and there are many fireballs. It is suitable for both visual observation and photography for beginners.
Yang Jing, an astronomy enthusiast in Tianjin, captured the Geminid Meteor Shower in Jizhou, Tianjin on December 13, 2020.
Astronomical forecasts show that this year’s Geminid meteor shower will reach its peak around 15:00 on December 14, with a ZHR (the number of meteors visible per hour under ideal observing conditions, when the radiant point is directly overhead) of 150.
Geminid Meteor Shower Recommendation Index Chart.
"Last year's'shooting stars' Geminid meteor shower left a deep impression on people, but this year's Geminid meteor shower will be affected by the moonlight, and the wonderfulness will be slightly reduced.
The 14th is the 11th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar. The moon is a waxing gibbous moon, and the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation. Fortunately, the moon will set in the second half of the night, and the radiant point of the Gemini Meteor Shower will rise higher.
Fans of the meteor shower can observe it in the hours after midnight after the moon sets, but should take care to keep warm. "
How can you see as many meteors as possible?
“It is not recommended to observe in the city. You can choose a place with high altitude, low light pollution and northeast exposure in the suburbs or countryside, and then wait patiently for the moon to set, and then observe visually.
It should be noted that the Geminid meteor shower has a large flux in all directions, so it is not necessary to stare at the radiant point of the Geminid meteor shower during observation.
If you like photography and want to shoot a gorgeous ‘ meteor shower film’, it is best to choose a wide-angle lens with a large aperture, and use a high ISO and maximum aperture when shooting.
Tripods, spare batteries and cable releases are also essential for stability and longevity. "
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What are the differences in market positioning between laser TVs and traditional TVs?
According to my understanding, the traditional TV mentioned by the poster should refer to the LCD TV, and the differences between laser TV and LCD TV in market positioning are mainly as follows:
First, laser TV is more focused on the large screen market.
Compared with the market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product born for the large screen.
At present, the mainstream sizes of LCD TVs range from 55 inches to 65 inches, while the sizes of laser TVs are generally above 75 inches, with the largest exceeding 100 inches, fully meeting the needs of users for large color TVs.
In recent years, the global shipment and sales share of laser TVs have been increasing, accounting for more than 60% of the total sales of TVs above 80 inches.
According to the forecast of ZhongyiKang, in 2020, the market sales growth of laser TV will exceed 140%, and continue to maintain rapid growth.
The reason for such good results in the large screen market is mainly due to the excellent performance of laser TV in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of laser TV diffuse reflection, the light emitted by the laser light source does not directly enter the eyeball. Compared with the backlight source of LCD TV, the imaging process is closer to the imaging process of objects under natural conditions, and the stimulus to the eyes is smaller.
Experts from the Saisi Laboratory of the China Electronic Technology Standardization Institute and the Ophthalmology Department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital conducted a strict comparison test of laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions, and obtained 144 sets of test data.
The data proves that laser TVs indeed have strong eye protection characteristics, and even have certain improvement effects in certain aspects.
At a time when vision health is becoming more and more important, laser TV has not only attracted more and more users with its eye protection advantages, but also opened up another breakthrough in the color TV market.
Second, laser TV is more focused on the high-end market.
Contrary to the falling prices of LCD TVs, the prices of laser TVs currently on the market are mostly over RMB10,000. As the size and light source upgrades, the prices are gradually rising.
Why is laser TV so expensive?
There must be a reason.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TV has many advantages that LCD TVs and projectors cannot achieve.
With ultra-short focal length projection technology, the projection distance of laser TV is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment. It can realize a 100-inch large screen experience within a short distance. It requires little space, and the host is small and takes up little space.
In terms of brightness, big-brand laser TVs can reach more than 2,000 lumens.
In addition, it has a lower heat output, low equipment wear and tear, and a longer service life.
In addition, many high-end laser TV models are equipped with true 4K ultra-high definition picture quality, artificial intelligence system, bionic screen and many other cutting-edge technologies, which can bring users a more shocking audio-visual experience.
It is not a false demand, but the product of demand segmentation. In terms of picture quality and input-output ratio, laser TV is not suitable for video players. It is not suitable for both large screen and viewing environment. It can be tried. Everything has advantages and disadvantages. After weighing the pros and cons, we can make our own judgment. We are afraid of believing in one-sided words.
Simply put, ultra-wide angle near-focus projector - laser TV, in order to close to the screen, had to use expensive ultra-wide angle lens and mirror, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to block out some of the ambient light, the use of microstructured Fresnel screen, the cost is high, the price of 80 inches basically can change a 65-inch LCD.
Also, I particularly dislike the fact that projector manufacturers use the fact that diffuse reflection is good for the eyes as a selling point. Come on, the light on the screen that the eyes can see is direct light. You diffuse the light to the ceiling, and the eyes can’t see it. If you insist that LCD TVs are also diffuse “direct” light, doesn’t the ceiling light up when you turn on the TV?
Furthermore, a projection screen cannot form an image unless it is diffuse.
The thermal spot (light spot) effect of the high-gain screen is ignored, and a large number of rays are reflected to the eyes at a certain angle, which is really uncomfortable.

I added the WeChat appointment date, and the little sister sent me the available time, and the reply was timely.
Before going to the store, I saw the shooting works, more outdoor wedding dress, very beautiful, involving a lot of shooting style.
After arriving on the day, I exchanged my ideas with my sister, and she patiently tried two sets of clothes that I was confused about. Finally, we decided to start makeup and hairdressing. Before the photographer started shooting, he would set up some props and instruct the movements. He was also very meticulous about the details.
But maybe because I didn't communicate with him about the specific shooting ideas, so the result is not the style I want, but it should be good-looking 🙊 🙊
After the photos are taken, the photographer will help choose the photos and communicate the post-production style. It feels quite meticulous.
It will take about half a month to repair the film, and wait for the effect.
For the second time, I won a free meal for a photo shoot. Most of the clothes in the store can be chosen for a photo shoot.
Finally, she chose a black sheath dress to experience a different style.
The whole shooting process takes about 2 hours, makeup + shooting, the photographer in charge of shooting is the younger brother of 95, feel a little green, hope that in the future customers shooting action guidance can give more advice, quite talkative, the shooting process is more pleasant.

Go to the home page and take a look at Queenie.
When I arrived at the store, I filled in my name and phone number, and then chose the clothing. The wedding dress can be chosen. I changed three or four sets of clothing and was very patient. After choosing, I made up for a long time. The service attitude was also good. The shooting will teach you how to pose. It feels like the face is so big. The fine editing is to take half a month, and it will be sent in three or four days. It feels like there is no difference between the original film and the original film.
[Environment] The overall environment is good.
There are a lot of options.
There are about three makeup stations inside the studio.
[Service] Very warm and attentive.
The stylist was very patient.
The photographer will also teach you the moves.
If they are not satisfied, the photographer will also offer to reshoot.
[Experience] The makeup may be a little over the top. The double eyelid was glued into a triple eyelid.
The ends of my eyebrows have also been shaved, which is a little embarrassing for someone who doesn’t normally wear makeup.
The photos were taken about ten days ago, but I was not satisfied with the effect of the photo editing. I felt that the double eyelid stickers were still very obvious.
Because I wasn’t sure what style I wanted, I tried two sets, but in the end, I chose the black dress. My sister said that this set was more Audrey Hepburn retro style.
After choosing the clothes, I started to do my hair and makeup. The hairdresser and makeup artist sisters were very patient in helping me. The effect was very satisfactory.
After makeup and hairstyle, we started to take photos. The photographer directed me to pose all the way. The process was very relaxed and harmonious.
After shooting, I carefully selected four of my favorite photos to be retouched. The little brother said that the photos would be ready within 15 days. I was very satisfied with the outcome.
It's been 3 days... I can't subscribe to #PRS_ORG #plus because your system won't recognise my card!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card for every payment
Now I have to pay shipping every time
Can I be exempted from the monthly fee until you finish your investigation?
Is it reliable to buy insurance from Little Umbrella?
Xiaoyumian is an internet insurance brokerage platform.
From the setting conditions: According to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Intermediaries (2015 Revision)", to become an insurance intermediary company, it must meet three key words: shareholders, sponsors have no major illegal records in the past three years, a minimum of RMB50 million can be established, and must be approved by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
These three requirements are actually very stringent. In summary, they require strength, approval from the State Authority of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (which supervises insurance companies and banks nationwide), and good conduct from shareholders. As an insurance brokerage company, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance does not need to be questioned as to whether it is legitimate or not. After all, these three requirements are not met by all insurance companies.
At this point, not bad, is trustworthy.
From the perspective of insurance products, Xiaoyu Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, and many companies’ star critical illness insurance are sold on this platform, such as the newly launched Hetai Super Mary 5 critical illness insurance, where both the claimant and the insurer are Hetai Life Insurance, and Xiaoyu Insurance is only a third-party intermediary, so there is no need to question its reliability.
From the point of view of the payment model: the products of the Internet platform, because of the lack of business outlets operating costs, and the cost of business staff salaries, so the Internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, supporting monthly payment, reducing the pressure of payment for the insured, while it can maximize the leverage of insurance.
That's pretty good.
It could be considered.
From the point of view of professionalism: This is particularly important, because insurance is an industry that requires a high degree of professionalism. Many Internet product customers can insure themselves. There will be many misunderstandings. In the area of health disclosure and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their own subjective consciousness when insuring, and they think they are healthy or compliant. It is easy to have many claims risks, and there is a risk of being denied.
I used to do insurance telemarketing at Tencent WeBao (just like Xiaoyu, it is also an internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can tell you that it is very responsible.
The insurance on the Internet is real and reliable, but the people are not reliable. There are no professional practitioners on the Internet channels, and there are also many sales misconceptions.
For example: 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million, buy insurance to send mobile phones, free to receive 60,000 heavy disease coverage, these marketing strategies are not wrong, but it avoids the important and trivial, will not tell the insured that the first month is 1 yuan, the next month is to charge normally, from dozens to 200, many customers do not know what they bought for a year or two.
They thought they could spend 1 yuan and the insurance company would pay 6 million yuan (a pie in the sky).
Free mobile phones are only given for special policy numbers, such as 6666 or 8888, and if you win the lottery, you won’t be reminded if you don’t redeem it.
(This is another pitfall for the insured) Free 60,000 yuan of critical illness coverage is short-term. If you only rely on this and do not have other commercial insurance, what can 60,000 do if a critical illness really happens? It can’t solve the problem, and your life will begin to run naked.
At present, the state is also cracking down on the misleading sales of Internet insurance.
So overall, the platform is no problem, the product is no problem, the problem is the professionalism and professional ethics of the salesman.
It is recommended that the poster carefully consider the overall situation. In fact, many offline insurance brokerage companies have a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from. Some products are also more cost-effective than Internet products.
I have helped 59 internet customers insure offline products, saving each of them 2,000-3,000 yuan per year.
If you have any questions, please feel free to communicate and exchange with me.
Me: Mingya Insurance Broker, with 3 years of business management training experience, served nearly 1,000 enterprise users, cooperated with more than 100 insurance companies. Before insurance, I will start from the needs of customers, tailor-made insurance products for customers, in the insurance, for customers to compare three, and strive to obtain the best underwriting results for customers, after insurance, for customers to do policy sorting, policy custody, so that customers can rest assured.
Grow with every customer for life.
I hope my answer can help you!
According to the definition of the insurance regulatory authority, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the insured can complete all the insurance procedures independently after clicking on the insurance link.
In this process, the policyholder does not need to sign, the insurance consultant does not need to sign, and all steps can be completed by the policyholder.
Although the insurance of Internet insurance does not have much “ceremony”, and may not even have a printed paper contract, this does not affect the validity and legal effect of the electronic contract.
This model, somewhat similar to the “telemarketing” assembly line, but such a purchase of insurance will also have a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades. When we buy insurance, should we seriously consider whether the “intermediary” we choose is an “insurance intermediary” that can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us in many years to come?

No problem, remember no need to arrange resend, I have bought separately, do not want to waste
Thank you for your help
From the past to the present, I oppose any form of slander and abuse, and cannot accept such personal attacks.
In civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of scoundrel.
If we don’t look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized practice.
I've been ignoring your Facebook friend request, your snarky posts, and your attempts to post my so-called home address and my father's name on social media.
Afterwards, you not only continued to tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, but also continued to discuss some obscure, humiliating remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as appearance, figure, good breeding, and what bed strawberries, whether to insert or not, and so on.
Later on, I received messages from several friends about a photo of you uploaded to your Facebook account with sexually explicit comments.
I'm sorry, but as a woman, I can't keep quiet anymore.
After my story was published, you didn't back off, you escalated.
I don’t care what your political background is, and I don’t care what your status is. In our society, we need gender respect.
Yes, you can continue with your snarky, veiled, shaming, abusive rhetoric, you can continue to say that you're just caring and concerned for me, you can continue to think that it's not harassment, you can even continue to deny that it's not your picture, and you can continue to spew all of your abusive rhetoric.
Yes, I can't, and I don't have the power to stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you. I don't need you to comment on my appearance and figure.
I don't even think any girl would want to be humiliated like that for fame.
A friend asked me, “How are you doing?”
You wouldn't believe me if I said yes.
I don't think any girl can say she's okay after being bullied like that.
Whether in the workplace, society, politics or business, it is only those who lack even basic decency who would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I took some of the comments for you to judge
I don’t think anyone can impersonate you if you post it yourself.
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization

Vietnamnet - Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh attends the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two major conferences were held during the 3rd Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, with the topics revolving around digital technology enterprises and the digital transformation of the country, and digital technology enterprises and the post-pandemic economic recovery and development.

Yangtze River Mainstream Realizes Full Coverage of Green Comprehensive Service Areas on Water - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11th (Reporter: Wang Xian) - The Fuling Water Green Comprehensive Service Area in Chongqing was completed and put into operation as scheduled on the 10th. This is the second water green comprehensive service area officially put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water Green Comprehensive Service Areas in Sichuan Province was put into operation on the 8th.
Up to now, the water-based green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
Qiu Jianhua, deputy director of the Yangtze River Waterway Administration of the Ministry of Transport, said that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have built and operated 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been recognized by the majority of sailors and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The comprehensive coverage of green service areas on the water is another milestone event in the construction of green shipping on the Yangtze River, and the capacity of receiving pollutants and shipping services on the Yangtze River has been significantly enhanced.
According to reports, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility that provides all-round production and living services for ships and crew, and helps crew members solve "urgent, difficult, anxious and hopeful" problems.
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas built and put into operation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are integrated with living services, production services, and government services. With green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and emergency ship rescue services as the characteristics, they can realize "one docking, multiple services" for ships in the port, which will make the work of sailors who sail the Yangtze River all year round more efficient and their lives more convenient.
Three U.S. Aircraft Carriers Gathered Around China, Most Powerful Weapon Rarely Visited Guam 2021-01-17 Multidimensional Pro-Beijing Media Multidimensional Report: The latest news on China-U.S. relations: The latest satellite images show that three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China; the U.S. media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the U.S. Navy's arsenal is rarely visiting Guam, sending important signals to the U.S. allies and opponents in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to the South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform, a Chinese think tank, on January 9, the satellite discovered the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier near the Balabak Strait.
The Balabarak Strait connects the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea and is a strategic location on the first island chain in the western Pacific Ocean.
The platform predicts that the USS Carl Vinson will deploy to the South China Sea.
This is the first deployment of the USS Carl Vinson with F-35C fighters and CMV-22 Osprey aircraft.
In addition to the USS Carl Vinson, the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3, is currently cruising in the Pacific Ocean.
The USS Lincoln is also home to the first F-35C Strike Fighter Squadron, part of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314.
In addition to the two aircraft carriers mentioned above, the USS Ronald Reagan, which is stationed in Yokosuka, Japan, is also deployed by the US Navy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the "Lake Champlain" missile cruiser and the "Stockdale" missile destroyer.
On January 17, 2022, the "South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness Platform" released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers were gathering around China.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) Three U.S. aircraft carriers gather around China, and the most powerful weapon makes a rare visit to Guam. On January 17, 2022, the flight path of a U.S. Navy CMV-22B aircraft carrier.
(Weibo @ South China Sea Strategic Situation Awareness) According to a CNN report on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy’s arsenal paid a rare visit to Guam over the weekend.
The USS Nevada, an Ohio-class nuclear submarine carrying 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, arrived at the US naval base in Guam on Saturday (January 15).
Three US aircraft carriers have gathered around China, and the most powerful weapon has made a rare visit to Guam. Analysts say this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit of a US ballistic missile submarine to Guam since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three U.S. aircraft carriers are gathering around China, and the most powerful weapon has made a rare visit to Guam. China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China’s Yongxu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) The U.S. Navy said in a statement that the Ohio-class nuclear submarine USS Nevada’s visit to Guam strengthened cooperation between the United States and its allies in the region, demonstrating the United States’ capabilities, flexibility, readiness, and continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called "boomer submarines."
The whereabouts of the US Navy's 14 "boom submarines" are usually kept secret.
The secrecy surrounding ballistic-missile subs made the "boomers" the "most survivable leg of the nuclear triad," which also included land-based missiles in silos in the United States and bombers like the B-2 and B-52 that could carry nuclear weapons.
Talking to friends about Meta's recent 26% drop in share price, with a market capitalization evaporating by US$251 billion, Zuckerberg responded that "unprecedented competition" was the reason. Why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company. Its revenue mainly comes from advertisements. Advertising companies that make money today have their own traffic channels.
Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on, no matter what kind of function positioning, are Meta's traffic channels.
What’s more, Meta is also the largest “advertising alliance”. Many apps are connected to Meta’s advertisements, and they realize monetization through Meta’s advertising platform.
But times have changed.
First, because of the adjustment of Apple’s privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to obtain user data, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple’s current privacy policy is very friendly to users, and it will clearly prompt users whether to allow apps to access their information, and the normal reaction of most people is certainly not to allow it.
And if Google stabs again, it will hurt Meta's revenue even more.
Second, the China factor in Meta's previous revenue growth has also weakened (it's not clear how big a factor this is, but it's there).
Everyone knows that Meta has no business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta’s annual revenue comes from China, mainly from Chinese companies doing business overseas.
Meta has an office of several hundred people in Hong Kong, and several major agents in the mainland.
When Chinese companies want to expand overseas markets, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and most of the money burned goes to Meta.
Interestingly, ByteDance's TikTok is now one of Meta's main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping ByteDance to advertise on Meta, and Meta’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven’t checked recently, but it can’t be any better than it was before.
The days when Chinese companies burned money abroad are over.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting old, and the new platforms, including TT, are not in Meta's hands.
The biggest problem is not just the decline in revenue, but the lack of growth expectations.
The capital market looks not only at revenue, but more importantly, at future expectations.
Clearly, Meta's expectations are not enough.
In order to tell a new story to the market, Zuckerberg talked about the “metaverse”.
The metaverse should indeed be one of the directions of the future, but the realization period of the metaverse is relatively long, and this story should not be enough to support Meta’s market value in the next two or three years.
So the next two years should be a difficult period for Meta.
Don’t look at Facebook now, which has an annual revenue of US$100 billion to US$200 billion. In fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis. Compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, it has no good safe moat.
Although some of his social software now has a high daily activity and is a mainstream social software, such as Facebook, WhatsApp and so on, but in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook also has no confidence, subversion between the blink of an eye.
And the metaverse is an unattainable concept. There is no hope of success in the short term. Therefore, Facebook is very dangerous. This is why Zuckerberg has changed the name of the company and is constantly looking for a new track. However, I think his choice of track is wrong and is a one-way street. The above is my thinking for reference.
